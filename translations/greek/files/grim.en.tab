#year1commentary	
coal0101	Tim: Can you imagine actually pulling yourself up a little chain of ties that are as long as the, um... Like--
coal0102	Peter M: Well, that's what's great about-- And then I like the view down.
coal0103	Tim: He's so calm about it, too. He's like, "Hyup hyup hyup hyup, ah! Many stories." I mean part of it is, I guess, he probably won't die.
coal0104	Peter M: He's already dead, I was going to say. He's already dead. So it's really just--
coal0105	Tim: And I was thinking, does he have the muscles to do that? Or else... No, he doesn't have any muscles. He's just a living skeleton. How is he moving? He's magic.
coal0106	Peter M: His spirit is animating, yes.
coco0201	Tim: The computers in the game are, um, I think where you can see Peter Chan's "Twelve Monkeys"-like influence. Like Terry Gilliam mix of, like... I don't know if you call it steampunk, but there's a lot of analog big tube-type things combined with Art Deco and old-fashioned typewriter keyboards.
coco0202	Peter M: Well, they had "steam" and "punk" in those days, right? But they didn't actually call it steampunk, right?
coco0203	Tim: The nineties? I think we might have had steampunk back then. Oh yeah.
coco0204	Peter M: Jeez. See, I told you I was from the "Mad Men" era.
coco0205	Tim: I'm so glad they made a show about you guys.
cofe0101	Tim: I don't know why we chose Robert Frost for the balloon shape, either.
cofe0102	Peter M: Oh, that was genius--
cofe0103	Tim: I just knew that it would be hard to make Robert Frost.
cofe0104	Peter M: Yes! And also because-- I think the whole implication is that the clown is way, way beyond his pay grade, and he has disdain for all those around him. And so he makes shapes that his lowly audience--
cofe0105	Tim: I never even thought about that being a testimony to the skills of the clown. I thought of it as Manny being a smartass. 'cause he asked for it. He's like, "Oh yeah? Can you do Robert Frost?" And then, of course, the clown does it.
cofe0106	Peter M: But, see, that's a Chandler thing, too, because the detective is always smarter than sort of the world that he's in. So he's teasing the clown.
cofe0107	Tim: So to speak.
cofe0108	Peter M: Yeah, so to speak. 'cause he knows the clown knows what Robert Frost looks like.
coga0101	Julian: You hear reverb on the steps, and you hear the reverb on his voice. And that was real-time reverb in a time when we never did that. We always prebaked the files with reverb. Jeff really had to fight for, I think it was, like, five percent of the CPU. But now anything that happens in this garage goes through that reverb. And, like, to modern game folks--audio people--it's just totally basic. No big deal. But back then it was such a big deal! And he really had to jump through hoops for it, and it's so great.
coga0201	Tim: Mark Hamer-- I remember [him] animating Glottis coming out. And he had to put this thing called a lattice on his butt. And so, "What are you working on, Mark?" "Oh, I'm working on the Glottis butt lattice." And he was always working on the Glottis butt lattice to morph and squash and stretch his butt as it came out of the door. And so, three cheers to Mark Hamer and his Glottis butt lattice. Amazing work still remembered to this day.
coha0101	Bret: So this was the first scene in the game that we ever actually did with some test assets. So I had to-- This was when I was proving out, "Okay, yes, we can do this." It was this hallway scene. We had Manny running up and down. We had the security-cam kind of camera switching. We had text on the screen. We had animations. We had geolocation of the sound relative to the camera--the typing was down the hallway. And we had Manny running up and down. It was a really good test scene and it kind of came through at the very last second. Literally, I was compiling code as people ran in the room because I had an awful bug. Um, but this was sort of like proof that, yes, we have all the elements to make this work. This was the first scene ever put together. And notice in the scene Manny hardly ever clips behind anything, and that's partially because I didn't have z-buffers working yet. But it was good enough that when people saw it they were really impressed, and I was kind of surprised because I was like the new guy at LucasArts and I was kind of half-assing my way through this and somehow made everybody really impressed. At that point I thought, "Okay, we can do this."
coha0201	Tim: My writing has changed a lot since this. Like, I was really trying to write good dialogue here, which to me at the time meant a lot of puns and like, um, word play. Like, "This suit is-- This deck of cards is a lot like me: it's ragged around the edges but I've got more suits..." I forget what it is, but everything had to be this kind of, like, bon mot.
coha0202	Peter M: Well, that's kind of Chandleresque, too. I mean, you know...
coha0203	Tim: Kind of, but I think I ease off on it in act two. I think I just start writing-- Or, in year two, there's a lot more just normal talking. Which I think I kind of like a little bit more now. I mean, it's fun to have crazy word play like that but you can just kind of trip over yourself a lot--too much--if you focus on that, I think.
coha0301	Peter M: So is there a reason that a lot of people who are in administrative positions of power have New York accents? Is that a...
coha0302	Tim: Everyone in the, um, jazz era was from New York.
coha0303	Peter M: Well, yeah, that's true.
coha0304	Tim: A lot of people don't know that.
cole0101	Bret: The ties. When Manny later uses the ties to cross over to the roof. [Tim] wanted it to be more like a little, you know, a little bit less adventure game and more sort of skill game, where you had to kind of, you know, line up the ties and throw the lasso and hook it on the thing. And I'll be honest with you, that was technically not something I was prepared to do in any way, shape, or form. It was kind of all I could do to make the rest of the stuff work. So, um, the ties and the beavers were--and actually the shocks on the tree--were all supposed to be a little bit more dynamic than a lot of the canned stuff you typically get in adventure games. We just couldn't do it.
cole0201	Peter M: I always liked the music up on the ledge.
cole0202	Tim: Me too! It was very Bernard Herrmann--"Vertigo."
cole0203	Peter M: And it always made me feel like a little... Maybe it's 'cause I actually have a little bit of vertigo, or whatever you say.
cole0204	Tim: But isn't that-- That happens a lot in "Vertigo"--the movie "Vertigo." Like the, um...
cole0205	Peter M: Yep, yep. Yeah, it probably comes from that.
cole0206	Tim: That dreamy, falling sensation.
cole0207	Peter M: Well, I'm a huge Bernard Herrmann fan. How can you not be? He was the guy who really brought kind of a seriousness of classical music to scoring. I mean, the guys before... There were great composers before him, they were a little more sort of, kind of the entertaining aspect of orchestral music. I think he was more really very serious about it.
colo0101	Bret: Ah, elevator code. Elevator code is the worst, man. Door code in general.
colo0102	Kevin: So there was a door box that you would draw on the ground. That would have data attached to it that would trigger the art and the, uh...
colo0103	Bret: Well, it's like the old-- Like when you walk into a supermarket in the old days, they didn't have a IR thing that was pointing at you. They had like a pad on the ground. You would roll your cart or step on the pad on the ground and it would automatically open the grocery store for you. It's just like that. There's a little invisible box that, uh, you cross that triggers all that stuff.
colo0104	Kevin: And then all the fiddly bits of people step on the box, step off the box, step back on it, while the doors are opening and closing. Those doors were broken for a long time.
colo0201	Peter T: Savvy viewers will note that the lobby is based on a real building in San Francisco with Mexican architecture. Uh, or Mayan Deco architecture. 450 Sutter, yeah, which is an actual building... Which is the inspiration for the whole business. Yeah, San Francisco is kind of a-- There's a lot of Deco-ish stuff around town, and that was a big part of making this world look the way it looked.
como0201	Gaurav: So this was actually the art test I took. I had to make this whole scene in a day.
como0202	Dave: Really?
como0203	Mark: Did they pay you for that?
como0204	Dave: One day?
como0205	Gaurav: Barely. I was so scared.
como0206	Dave: How much did you get done?
como0207	Gaurav: Uh, I think almost all the geometry. In some cases it used to be an overnight render.
como0301	Tim: I love pneumatic tubes! If you ever read articles about old New York, there's a lot of stuff about how the tube system was... There was an interbuilding tube system, too.
como0302	Peter M: Oh, really?
como0303	Tim: I don't know how that could possibly work! And the tubes were sixteen inches in diameter, and they would shoot pneumatic messages, like, they'd push them between buildings. Now those tubes are there. They're thinking about using them for fiber-optics and stuff like that.
coos0101	Tim: I love that mural 'cause it's the three ways of travelling in the Land of the Dead: the car, the train, and the boat. There's no air travel in the Land of the Dead. No "Land of the Dead Airlines."
copk0101	Alex: Down in QA, we got on the project way, way earlier than we ever had on any other project and we would play the game with the concept art on the screen. But Manny was modeled, and done, and lit... Well, maybe he wasn't lit, I don't know, but he would zoom around the concept art, and it was all black and white. And uh, that's why I was...
copk0102	Paul: Oh, that would be neat!
copk0103	Alex: Yeah.
cost0101	Dave: I think the camera choices in this game were actually pretty fantastic as well. I don't know who was responsible for that. Was it storyboarded or...
cost0102	Mark: Was that you, Pete?
cost0103	Peter T: Yeah, probably. A little bit. A lot of stuff got worked out ahead of time, certainly. I mean because, you know, we didn't necessarily build full three-sixty 3-D worlds. I mean except for like the offices and stuff.
cotu0101	Dave: You know, the games we make nowadays we try to keep them real-time. And the environments will come in the tens of thousands of polygons, probably. But, uh, or at least under a hundred, I would say at least at the TellTale studio. But here they I think were almost unlimited, unless it crashed the machines all the time.
cotu0102	Peter T: Yes, it was unlimited, and it was like trying to render it on your iPhone, which was crazy.
cotu0103	Mark: He modeled like every single nut and bolt everywhere in there, and they were all high-res.
cotu0104	Gaurav: Yeah, I was about to say a certain amount of this was us not--
cotu0105	Dave: "It might get a close-up!"
cotu0106	Gaurav: ... really knowing and us not being efficient about how we set everything up.
cotu0107	Mark: As an animator, when you open one of these environments to animate in, you had to basically throw everything away except for the one thing that Manny touches or walks next to or something.
cobv0101	Bret: This scene, actually, this is, uh-- The beavers here are another good example of like, you know, why you have to have coroutines in games because, you--at least, in adventure games. You have to have like a script that just says, "How's this beaver going to behave? What's he going to do?" And at the time that people were making games, scripting engines weren't popular yet, you had a lot of games in C [programming language]. And somebody would've been trying to write in their game engine, in their game loop, "And go run the beavers now." In a scene like this you had to be able to take that and say, "This is how a beaver behaves. Right now I'm thinking like a beaver. How would a beaver-- He's going to crawl over here, he's going to chew on these things. Then he'll get tired, then he'll jump over here." Same thing with the pigeons and everything else. And that, again, I didn't have to think about the fact that they were needed. They were obviously needed. I mean, that's one of the things that SCUMM had made very obvious, like, you cannot make adventure games without coroutines. They didn't even call them coroutines, though. I mean, we didn't even know what to call them for a long time until--
cobv0102	Kevin: Threads.
cobv0103	Bret: They were just threads, yeah. And actually, well that was one of the early experiments. I actually tried to use actual Windows threads. 'cause this was a Windows game; it wasn't a DOS game. This was a Windows game. We can use actual threads! I initially did try and actually have different Lua threads, and it was like, it was just so heavyweight. Machines are so tight and it was so much overhead. And it was so complex. It was like, we need something lightweight. It needs to be really focused on what the game does.
cobv0201	Lleslle: This one was, um--
cobv0202	Julian: How could you ever cut this?
cobv0203	Lleslle: I know, but programmatically it was buggy. And it caused-- It was hard. No one understood how to solve this puzzle for quite a long time. And so I was like, "Look, you gotta pick something," and we hadn't started it yet. So this is a classic Tim technique. When you want to cut something, he will start putting it in the game. So that everything gets in. So, uh, yeah. Funny, funny.
cobv0301	Tim: They were-- We were like, "Where is the fire-- What is the flame source for the beavers?" And they were like, "Well, they have a nuclear core." They have a nuclear core. So they're thermonuclear flaming bone beavers.
cobv0302	Peter M: Yeah, you know, I have to say. Flaming bone beavers. I mean--
cobv0303	Tim: You would think that would be controversial. A band? A band name.
cobv0304	Peter M: Maybe, yeah.
cobd0101	Tim: I still remember writing a big justification about tank controls when I was pitching this. People were like, "Let's make it so the controls are more like Mario." Where you push-- No, no, point-and-click. I was thinking-- Tank controls I thought were superior to point-and-click at the time because when you're pointing and clicking you're distant from the screen, and the screen is this other thing that you're interacting with at your finger tips.
cobd0102	Peter M: Right, you're seeing--
cobd0103	Tim: But when you're doing tank controls, you feel like you are in the center of the character. The world is rotating around you. So when you think-- Instead of going, "I want to go on the left of the screen" or "I want to go on the right of the screen," you're saying, "I want to look at the thing to the left of me, and the thing to the right of me." And now I don't know if that was necessarily the right decision, but it's a good piece of evidence that you can somehow, sometimes make a really good argument for the wrong decision, and that's something to watch out for in life. You know what I mean? You can make a really compelling [case], and in fact win an argument, and be totally wrong.
cobd0104	Peter M: Winning an argument has nothing to do with being right, that's for sure.
cobd0105	Tim: Exactly, exactly. It's just being able to make a good case.
cotu0201	Tim: This line that he says a lot actually comes from the old IT guy at LucasArts. We'd say, "Hey, the server's down." And he goes, "The server's not down. It's never down. You just can't get to it right now."
cona0101	Lleslle: Well, this is the area that Tim and I would make a lot of jokes about because, you know. Producer-type person, I need to shorten the game. Cut it somehow. So this area, I would say, "Hey, we need to cut... the beavers. Does that make sense?"
cona0102	Julian: He's like, "No way, not cutting it."
cona0103	Lleslle: Well, he-- The whole time we'd fight about it, and it was that one kind of thing where, um... That was the story I told a little earlier, about the ship, you know? He said, "Lleslle, a game is like a ship, and the ship is going, and it's going to keep going until it stops." And I was like, what kind of logic is that? It has to finish at some point. So I was like, "Look, the beavers gotta go." They'd always be on the list. And he actually drew me little pictures on a napkin of, like, the armadillo, the beavers on fire. And he's like, "Why did you cut me, Lleslle? Please don't cut me, Lleslle." And he would just poke me.
cona0104	Julian: That's so funny.
cona0105	Lleslle: Yeah.
colb0101	Tim: This is like a callback to, um, "Those Brave Young Men and Their Jaunty Jalopies." You ever see that movie? "Those Outrageous Young Men and Their Flying Machines."
colb0102	Peter M: Oh, that I remember.
colb0103	Tim: They're these two crazy movies from the sixties, which were all about-- It was kind of like the "Wacky Races," but a real life version--
colb0104	Peter M: [singing] "Those magnificent men and their flying machines, ey!"
colb0105	Tim: It was kind of like "Wild, Wild, Wild World," or whatever--
colb0106	Peter M: "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."
colb0107	Tim: Where all these people are chasing some crazy prize. But the cars in it always had things like that. I think that is a direct lift. Like, one of the cars would have these hydraulic shocks that lifted up, or just crazy extending things.
colr0101	Tim: What is this crazy music? How did you get it all warp-sounding?
colr0102	Peter M: Well, that's a great... See, remember that when I did all the themes for "Grim" I carried around a little handheld cassette, right? So I'd go for my hike in the hills in the morning and I'd carry my little cassette with me and if something popped in my head I would hum into it.
colr0103	Tim: And it dropped into a puddle?
colr0104	Peter M: Well, those cassettes... I don't know if you remember much about cassette technology, 'cause, you know--
colr0105	Tim: I remember cassettes. I made some mixtapes.
colr0106	Peter M: They didn't always last--especially the little, tiny ones--didn't last for a super long time. So if you used it all the time, which I did to compose, the machine heads--the mechanism--would start to wear out. Especially if it ran low on batteries. So yeah, that was me sitting at the piano, working on that theme for the Land of the Living which I recorded on a little handheld cassette, and then played it back with batteries that were running out. And recorded that into the digital system.
colr0107	Tim: That's awesome. Was that an accident at first? It ran out of power at an earlier time, writing something else?
colr0108	Peter M: You know, I can't remember. I think it was an accident, but I kind of meant to do it, too.
colr0201	Tim: In the Land of the Living, the people look horrifying because of that-- Have you ever seen that optical illusion where you take a picture of someone from a magazine, you cut rectangles out of their eyes and their mouth, and then turn them upside down? And they just look like demons.
colr0202	Peter M: Oh, yeah, yeah. Totally.
colr0203	Tim: That's the Land of the Living.
codo0101	Bret: There's a scene here. So there's the wine bottle there on the side. Or sorry, the bourbon bottle. And there's the taking a slug of his booze. That was actually-- We had lots of math problems early in the game where we were lining up camera angles, like you mentioned. These camera angles, if we had it off between the real-time and the pre-rendered stuff, things got kind of messy. That was one of the first scenes we had where Manny as one character goes and interacts with another item in the scene, and it also has to be placed very precisely in the scene because it has to appear to be on the shelf. And it was really difficult to coordinate, you know. He has to walk to exactly the right spot, line up to perform his animation. The cup has its own animation of flying through the air to his mouth. There's all these weird ways we handled it. I think we changed that later to handle it better, so that the cup was actually attached, we could swap it in. Blank out the one that was on the shelf, put in the one that was in his hand. It's like a magic trick. Originally, that was something we used to test it out and make it work. It was-- I remember spending days on that. Just being worried like, "Oh man, we're never going to get this to align perfectly between 2-D and 3-D."
codo0201	Peter T: I remember something about the mural. This would be the mural in, uh... What's that guy's name? The nemesis's office.
codo0202	Dave: Domino?
codo0203	Peter T: Domino, yeah. The mural on the ceiling of Domino's office. There was something. I think maybe that angle wasn't planned or something in the game, and then whoever did the textures for that room put this crazy mural on there. And so it was like, "We have to show the mural! We have to get that up there." I remember there was some sort of fiasco around that mural.
codo0204	Dave: Usually, it's the other way around. Usually artists put a bunch of beautiful work into something and then someone turns the camera the other way and doesn't show it.
codo0205	Paul: Right, exactly.
codo0301	Tim: How is he sweating without skin? So inaccurate. Tried to get it really accurate with the punching. You know: left, left, right, right, left, left, right... I think that's how you do it. Well, you don't just do one, two, one, two with the speed bag.
codo0302	Peter M: Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah it looks--
codo0303	Tim: In my boxing history.
codo0304	Peter M: My grandpa used to have a boxing bag in his basement. He showed me how it works once.
cosm0101	Darragh: That line right there, "Love is for the living. I'm only after her for one reason. She's my ticket out of here," that was the key line that Tony and I would always go back to, that kind of identified who that character was. The idea with Manny being a Hispanic Humphrey Bogart-- That line evoked "Casablanca" in many ways and, um, that was kind of just... We worked on that line longer than we should have. But it was just one of those that we just felt was important to kind of nail and help define Manny.
cosm0102	Clint: And you could see Pete's musical treatment of it. He kind of suspended the music, and had this little classical guitar melody that had a feeling of being like a pocket in time, to further highlight that line, yeah.
cogs0101	Tim: I never realized how weird it was that he gets locked into a room by his boss, which I don't think is legal.
cogs0102	Peter M: Oh, you know back in the thirties you could do all kinds of stuff. You know, rubber hoses for cops and so on. It was just fifty years after the Old West.
cogs0103	Tim: Whoa, that's weird to think about.
cogs0104	Peter M: Yeah.
cohq0101	Peter T: There's some concept art there in the PowerPoint.
cohq0102	Paul: Yeah, 'cause I remember I just took [Peter Chan's] stuff and, like, inverted it to make it look like a plan.
cohq0103	Peter T: Oh, really? You took someone else's textures and reused them.
cohq0104	Paul: Great artists borrow... No, wait. Good artists steal. Um, yeah.
cohq0201	Tim: Oh, the secretary has a dual identity! It's always lots of fun with dual identities. I like that Eva gets to have a little, like, um... She's got more going on that you thought she did.
cohq0202	Peter M: I love that, too. And I like that there's something fishy in the Department of Death, too. That's a good twist.
como0101	Darragh: This is one of the scenes where we had Tony and Maria Canals in working together. They're both from Cuba and had worked together before they were cast in Grim. So it was kind of fun to get the two of them together again and play off of each other, which is of course the way you'd like to do any game.
corf0101	Tim: I used to work at a doctor's office, and one of the jobs-- Just terrible jobs there. And one of them was the roof was covered in, like, six inches of pigeon guano up there. They had a flat roof like the roof of this building. And they're like, "Look, we gotta get that stuff off the roof. It's really, it's going to break the roof. There's so much pigeon crap on the roof." And I had to go up there with this flat shovel. It was kind of like cutting brownies out of a pan. I was just chopping up the bird poop and just scooping it up and throwing it off the roof. But in chopping it up I would occasionally find, like in sedimentary rock, like an archaeologist or a paleontologist, I would find the bones of a dead pigeon just inside this weird brownie of guano on the roof.
corf0102	Peter M: Wow.
corf0103	Tim: So I had my fair share of bad jobs.
corf0104	Peter M: This really, this was really a kind of therapy to get that traumatic experience--
corf0105	Tim: Yeah, there's not enough poop on the roof to make this really--
corf0106	Peter M: Well, it's hard to indicate that with the technology of the time. Kind of just like-- It's like if you did wind in a 8-bit game it just sounded like [8-bit wind noise]. It just sounded bad, you know.
corf0107	Tim: At least I got to clear the pigeons from the roof of my memories.
core0101	Tim: I really wanted to have this moment of Velasco bonding with Glottis through the magic of cars, talking about engines and stuff...
core0102	Tim: Cars bring people together. Talking about engines.
core0103	Tim: Because I never had sports--
core0104	Peter M: Internal combustion...
core0105	Tim: I never liked sports. I was not into the manly unifier of sports, but--
core0106	Peter M: Me neither.
core0107	Tim: Cars you can talk about with the toughest of dudes.
core0108	Peter M: That's true, that's true.
cori0101	Darragh: The character Celso is played by a really funny actor called Peter Lurie. When he came into the studio, the first day, he had this real look of apprehension about him. It turned out the word in Hollywood was that "Grim Fandango" was code name for "Star Wars: Episode I" casting. So when he was coming in for the project people were telling him, "You're going to be going in, and George Lucas is going to be there. They're going to be flying you up to the ranch!" He was terribly disappointed when he walked in and the only person in the studio was me.
cori0201	Peter M: When you run into Celso Flores again and there's that-- You know, he's always down and out and he's listening to this music on the radio while he's working, which is actually Hector's music. All of the-- Most of the jazz pieces are some variation on Hector's theme, and they're being piped in everywhere. Like every time you listen to something on the radio it's actually Hector's music and it's sort of this idea that Hector is behind everything and in control of all the-- Pulling all the strings of commerce, and then here's this little guy. Celso's mopping the floor and with this reminder that he's just a little guy in a big world with these big forces.
cori0202	Tim: That's awesome.
cori0203	Peter M: Does that sound too philosophical?
cori0204	Tim: I think that works on a primal level. I don't think I was conscious of that, but I think it was working.
cori0301	Tim: I love the tiling floor. It's my favorite part in this one. And the fact that it's a automat, which was part of a period reference, too. Like those ways that you-- There used to be these restaurants in New York where you'd go--or big cities--where you'd go in and the food was ready for you behind these little panels, and you would just open the door and take it. Which is an interesting way of serving stuff. Like just separate the server from the eater, I guess? I don't know.
cori0302	Peter M: Oh, that is, I never--
cori0303	Tim: Like you don't want to see the wait staff, so they're behind this wall, because of some weird social reason.
cori0304	Peter M: That is weird.
cori0305	Tim: And they didn't really have automats anymore, but I always thought that's what was behind that.
cori0306	Peter M: It does seem a little impersonal, doesn't it?
cosp0101	Tim: This is me playing with my own worst fears. I was realizing while we were making this game, randomly I was thinking about how nice it is that spiders can't fly. You know, with spiders-- Spiders are kind of icky, but they're on the wall. You can stay away from them. Don't go in the garage. Don't get fire wood, ever. You can stay away from spiders. But what if they could fly? What if you had instead of a bee buzzing around you or something, you had to worry about like, there's a black widow. Wouldn't that be creepy? So we made flying spiders in the game.
cosg0101	Clint: We coined a phrase called "McConnellian" ambience, meaning Pete McConnell. His style of ambience where you have a little idea, and then a completely different idea, and then a completely different idea, just sort of sequenced. The texture would get kind of big, and then it would get very small with a solo clarinet. Then something completely different would happen and then you'd get a little bassoon. And so these ideas would waft in and out like clouds, or just passing notions. It's a great way to keep the listener entertained but not get in his way. So we termed that a McConnellian approach to ambience.
cosg0201	Tim: I always like Glottis because he's just so pure in his-- I mean, he's by definition pure in that he's just the spirit of driving, kind of. Someone from the land itself. He has no-- Given nothing but a desire to drive and go fast, and all his motivations are about like, um, moving at high speed. He almost dies because he's going too slow at some point and he has to go fast again to come back to life. But he also obviously cares about friendship and Manny, and he's a very loyal character.
cotr0101	Clint: I remember in this room--as in several others, Julian--we used a sound ambience that we recorded using a contact microphone on various machines, like Coke machines, other vibrating devices or machine-like devices that produces a kind of interesting hum. If you put your ear up against a Coke machine, or-- I was just on the Golden Gate Bridge last week and I stuck my ear up against one of those three hundred, two hundred foot pylons and it's amazing the resonances that are going on in those type of resonant bodies. And we would record things like that and turn them into ambiences for some of the rooms.
cotr0201	Tim: Some of the things that we came up with for this game, like the, um... petrified forest. Petrified forest was right out of a Bogart movie, right? That comes from the name of a Bogart movie.
cotr0202	Peter M: And he's actually a gangster.
cotr0203	Tim: He's a bad guy in it, yeah. But, um, having these little things pumping-- I don't even know where this, like, came up with... I feel like in games now we try to make things kind of make sense. Like, oh, you go to a gas station, something you know that exists. But here it's a weird hydraulic pump factory with a counterweight on top of it for sucking something out of the marrow out of these trees.
cotr0204	Peter M: Oh, right.
cotr0205	Tim: But it was all worth it 'cause it was satisfying to see Glottis spin around on the top of it.
cotr0206	Peter M: I like the environmental message myself.
#year2commentary	
cocb0101	Lleslle: And just the amount of research that went into all of this, 'cause I just remember Tim going to every film noir movie, ever. And we would just-- All the time, there would be something to do. And he's like, "Wanna go to the movies?" And it was just, I mean you can see it. The dark shadows, and then the music. I mean, everything is just so film noir and really pulls you in.
cocb0102	Darragh: Yeah, and I remember us all going to see "Casablanca." I think it was in The Castro Theatre. It was one of those old San Francisco theaters. I forget which one it was, but it was, a whole gang of us went.
cocb0103	Lleslle: Yeah, remember-- Did you guys go to the, um, Golden Gate Fields for the horse races?
cocb0104	Darragh: I didn't do that.
cocb0105	Clint: I wish.
cocb0106	Lleslle: That was part of it, 'cause I think there were some scenes around that. And that was just fun, I mean, just the research trips.
cocb0107	Darragh: Yeah.
cocb0108	Lleslle: Those were fun.
cotw0101	Tim: You hear the cats racing? We were always so sad that we never showed the cat races, but that was for budget reasons, obviously. We didn't want to cut the actual cats. But I wanted to have giant cats running on a track... Like that!
cotw0102	Peter M: And the idea of cats racing, being herdable enough to race is pretty... Why cats?
cotw0103	Tim: Um, why cats? There was a... God, I don't remember. Why cats? That's a good idea.
cotw0104	Peter M: I mean, I just remember making the music, going [cat yowling noises] at some point, 'cause you're near the kitty litter.
cotw0105	Tim: Mm hm, mm hm.
cotb0101	Bret: You know, there are all these background scripts that do things as you enter a room. It's like it's, you know, "Start all these scripts when you enter the room. Do all these backgrounds actions." Then we leave the room, supposed to stop all those scripts. And it was all left to chance--left to programmer error. And, uh, there was one. We were talking about this earlier. There's a script that runs the cat races, and it runs the announcer for the cat races. And it actually, true to Tim's attention to detail he wanted it to actually simulate cat races, and--
cotb0102	Kevin: There are actual cat races going on.
cotb0103	Bret: There are cats that are being raced and they, the same name will show up and you'll hear this cat getting ahead of the other one. I think Chris Purvis did that.
cotb0104	Kevin: Yeah, and the odds are real. The winnings are real. Just...
cotb0105	Bret: Manny's wallet fills up during the course of the game... No, the cat races are running and so in the background the announcer is running, and it's the simulation of these cat races being run. And, um, yeah they never killed that script. So you play the rest of the game from that cat scene and the cat race simulator script is always running.
cotb0106	Kevin: Yes, from the moment the cat races start to the end credits of the game.
cotb0107	Bret: To the end of time.
cotb0108	Kevin: The cat race simulation is going on in the background.
cotb0109	Bret: There are still kitties racing today.
cotb0110	Kevin: Yes.
cobk0101	Dave: In the final version of the game, are the backgrounds actually just pre-rendered flats?
cobk0102	Peter T: Yes, they are.
cobk0103	Dave: See, that's amazing to me 'cause we live in a world of 3-D now. We're used to floating the camera around inside of these things. But, you know, once you chose your camera angle to pre-render something, that was it. There you go.
cobk0104	Peter T: No, it's Manny walking around in a blank 3-D room with z-depth data to clip him in front of the stuff that he needs to clip in front of.
cobb0101	Tim: I'm a strong believer in things that should be-- When you're making stuff, it should be something that could only have been made by you, or in that group of people and at the time you made it, in the place you made it.
cobb0102	Peter M: Yes.
cobb0103	Tim: You know? I think "Grim" is definitely that case. Like, only-- That's one of the great things about "Grim." I think it's a collection of amazing artists, like you, and the visual artists, and the programmers, and the actors. And everything that came together for that game was just such a-- Was almost overwhelming distraction of amazing artists coming together. Like, "Oh my God, look at that background! Oh my God, listen to this music! Oh my God, listen to that voice!" So I think it makes that game really special. But it also has a lot of personal details that are just kind of woven into it that makes it. So like even if we were making this game from scratch, with the same intentions today, it would just be completely different.
cobp0101	Tim: I don't know why there's so much, uh, union jokery in games that I've worked on. But I've always found it, um, maybe because it was a big part of, like, movies of that era, like "On the Waterfront." You know, and not so much unions but mobster corrupt unions.
cobp0102	Peter M: Right.
cobp0103	Tim: There's always a big part of that, you know, going on. And then also, like, worker/anti-worker Communist themes going on. Like, it was all tied together. And I don't know if that all sprung out of "On the Waterfront", or...
cobp0104	Peter M: Well, "On the Waterfront" though was kind of, um... I mean, it was... sort of championing the... whatever, the plight of the working man, but it also was talking about the dark side of the union thing, for sure.
cobp0105	Tim: But it was a corrupt union, it was--
cobp0106	Peter M: Yeah, it was.
cobp0107	Tim: It was a mob-run deal.
cobp0108	Peter M: That's true.
cocc0101	Lleslle: So Tim created a character which I very much appreciate. I love her. Her name is Lupe, and she happens to be a little bit based on me and my idiosyncrasies. And so when he--I remember one time we were hanging out, and he told me, he's like, "See, how can you tell me that I don't understand our relationship? Like, I can write about it." And I was like, "What are you talking about?" And he said, "See, she's super organized, nobody listens to her, but she has a lot of really important things to say. And, see, we need her! And that's what you've realized."
cocc0102	Darragh: That's awesome.
cocc0103	Lleslle: So I was like, "Oh, I love you." And she does karate kicks. That was the best 'cause I like to punch people. And so if you notice sometimes--I don't know if they have it in here--but she, uh, she punches in the air. She does air punches.
cocc0104	Clint: That's awesome.
cocc0105	Darragh: She was really easy to cast because I had such a great frame of reference for her.
cocc0106	Lleslle: Oh, nice. Thank you!
cocc0201	Tim: These scenes are from the production of the game in a way, where Lleslle would come to me like, "Look what I made! I made a chart of every single scene in the game, plus every single actor, and I coded it. Yellow means Manny's in it, and blue means this prop is in it," and she was so excited about these things that she did, and this character's doing the exact thing.
cocc0202	Peter M: Yup.
cocc0203	Tim: You have to take things from your life and put them in your work, you know. Even though they don't really mean anything to anybody else.
cocc0204	Peter M: Well, then that just means work will be about life, rather than life being about work, right?
cocc0205	Tim: Exactly, exactly.
codh0101	Paul: No, and I think this is one of my first sets. Oh, yeah! I remember this is-- Both of those were... Well, it was one of the first [environments] that I ever modeled. And again, it was very simple. Very simple geometry.
colm0101	Darragh: That's Kay Kuter. And Kay was, I don't know, late seventies, early eighties. Um, and big long gray beard... And he was a raging smoker. So you'd have to break him every forty-five minutes, otherwise he'd start getting into a really bad mood. And on one of those sessions, we were doing-- He plays the croupier later on, where he speaks French and English. It's just, he delivers the numbers. We were behind on time and so I sort of pushed him to an hour, and all of a sudden I found myself in an argument with Kay over how to pronounce "twenty" in French. And so I was like, "It's definitely time for a smoke break. [I'll just go] and get out of here."
cosd0101	Darragh: That's Raphael Sbarge, who, um-- He was actually the main character in "Knights of the Old Republic," in the original game. But Raphael, he's a big on-camera guy. Hadn't really done a lot of voice-over. And there's a scene later on where he's addressing all of the workers. And the thing about Raphael is that he physically performs when he's in the studio. So as he was addressing the field he kept on going off mic. So the engineer's like, "Oh, we gotta keep him on mic." So I said, "Hey, Raphael. You know, can you stay on mic?" He's like, "Oh! Really sorry, really sorry." We re-rolled and all of a sudden his energy just went [plummeting sound]... down."
cosd0102	Julian: Oh, interesting.
cosd0103	Darragh: It just wasn't working the same way, so we pulled out another two mics and put them out.
cosd0104	Julian: Oh, that's great!
cosd0105	Darragh: He could then go, you know, "You are the fat cats of industry!" and he could kind of move his head, and we still caught it. So then we just cut around, um, the three tracks to get the final take."
cosd0106	Julian: Oh, that's so crazy.
cosd0107	Darragh: Yeah... He's a great actor.
cosd0201	Tim: This is where-- I had never heard of actual Seabees before, and someone made that-- I talked about how there could be these bees down there. And they're like, "Oh, like Seebees!" And I was like, "What? What are Seabees?"
cosd0202	Peter M: Yeah, they were a Navy thing.
cosd0203	Tim: And, wait, does that come from the letters CB? like...?
cosd0204	Peter M: I don't know.
cosd0205	Tim: "Construction brigade" or something?
cosd0206	Peter M: Like Jeep comes from "General Personnel Vehicle," yeah.
cosd0207	Tim: So, and this bee is called Terry because the character from "On the Waterfront"--Marlon Brando's character named "Terry." Um, so that's where we got all that stuff.
code0101	Alex: But I do remember-- Did you guys notice, or do you remember this, that you couldn't solve this puzzle if you had a fast computer?
code0102	Paul: Really?
code0103	Alex: Yeah so right after the game shipped computers, you know, got better, right? And so the processors were much, much faster. And there's a timing element to this puzzle. And if your computer was too fast there was not enough time to actually execute and do the puzzle.
code0104	Dave: That's pretty awesome.
code0105	Alex: Yeah, so that was a bummer.
code0106	Dave: And not awesome.
code0201	Tim: This was our first 3-D game, and it's funny to see how many puzzles are about the physical properties of things. As opposed to, in a 2-D adventure game you would never make something based on the shape of something, or leverage. Like that whole puzzle was very physical, like you had to move these two objects and stop them from sliding past each other, and the fork lift jacked up on its back wheels. I think we were just so excited to be in a world of physical stuff, or maybe because we were in a world of physical stuff we had to actually make it physically realistic.
coev0101	Paul: I think we're going to come up to Gaurav's set that I destroyed-- That I destroyed two weeks of Gaurav's work, um, by trying to learn how to 3-D model. And somehow I ended up erasing two weeks of his work. It was the fish place that you had to redo.
coev0102	Gaurav: Oh yeah, the elevator!
coev0103	Paul: Yeah, the elevator and that place with the fish.
cose0101	Bret: To some extent, "Grim Fandango" is a bit of a mutt. It's got pieces of "Jedi Knight," it's got pieces of SCUMM, it's got pieces of "Outlaws." It's got pieces of, you know it's got iMUSE coming in, it's got the Lua language. So it was a game kind of made-- You know for all the technical challenges in it, a lot of pieces were sort of pre-existing, and kind of, it was a matter maybe of a new era of game development where you don't write everything from scratch, but you kind of put it together in the best possible way.
cose0102	Kevin: Well, and one of the side effects of that was since we had pretty robust solutions to video playback and rendering and art pipes in front of us, it really, a lot of the effort--aside from just making everything, all the blocking and tackling working--was spent in on how to make making games like this convenient and producible and artist-friendly, and uh... You know, you had built some tools that were really unlike the things that appeared in Renderdroid or Smush or some of the technologies it was built on. So it's a bit of a mutt in that we borrowed a bunch of really great technology, but there was also a lot of really innovative stuff.
cohl0101	Julian: Well, I remember--speaking of VO--I remember you casting this, and then I remember you vanishing. And you were gone for so long, recording this.
cohl0102	Darragh: Yeah, I was down in-- Actually, it was the one time we rented an apartment rather than stay at a hotel. I was down in LA recording this for six weeks, and then I was book-ended on either side with two weeks for two Lucas Learning projects. And so it was, uh...
cohl0103	Julian: Yeah, you just moved away.
cohl0104	Darragh: Yeah, yeah. It was a long time.
cohl0201	Mark: Is that cat actually modeled, or is that a painting?
cohl0202	Paul: No, that's a modeled cat. That's a--
cohl0203	Mark: The lighting is so soft, it's...
cohl0204	Paul: I think I might've even-- Oh, please, please, did I do that? Did I model that cat? I might've modeled that cat.
cohl0205	Mark: It's a cool-looking cat, just the lighting--
cohl0206	Paul: Oh, thank you.
cohl0207	Dave: [with accent] Is one sexy cat.
cohl0301	Tim: Wait, why did-- How did Glottis leave the piano-playing thing and come down here? Oh, you got him the pass. You gave him a pass.
cohl0302	Peter M: Right, and now he's a high roller.
cohl0303	Tim: And he's an alcoholic and a gambler because of you. But it's all for a good cause: adventure game-playing.
colx0101	Tim: I mean, that was always my favorite piece of concept art, was the flowers flying off the lighthouse.
colx0102	Peter M: Yes!
colx0103	Tim: This lighthouse is always so beautiful.
colx0104	Peter M: Yeah.
colx0105	Tim: And, um, a lot of those noir stories just have these really hard luck characters who don't get a break. And you know, the private eye's trying to solve the story, but they'll meet someone along the way who just gets bumped off and it's not their fault, and they just get wrapped up in things and--
colx0106	Peter M: Yeah, like the little two-time crook in--or two-bit crook--in, uh, "The Big Sleep," who drinks the poison but doesn't spill the beans, as it were, yeah.
colx0107	Tim: And Lola's one of those, um--
colx0108	Peter M: Lola's one of those characters.
colx0109	Tim: -- those victims. But you get to learn a lot!
colx0110	Peter M: Who's faithful but down and out.
colx0201	Bret: So all the water in year two was a mess. And I was actually very unhappy about the water because they loved making realistic-looking water, and they wanted to use all these shaders in Softimage to make the water look awesome. Have waves and everything. And so there's all these scenes, like this lighthouse scene, where there's like huge amounts of the screen are just undulating water, which compresses terribly for Smush and video. It was just awful. And that's all through this part of year two and I kept-- I got so freaked out because I thought that we'd never be able to do anything if we're just having every background-- We might as we all make every background be a full running movie at this rate.
colx0202	Kevin: Yeah, it was like for the film industry--where Softimage was mostly being used--water was kind of the soup du jour. It was-- Everybody was doing water.
colx0203	Bret: "How good is your water?"
colx0204	Kevin: Yeah, and so you would fire up Softimage and it could do all this amazing water simulation.
colx0205	Bret: I remember arguing with Peter [Tsaykel] about it, 'cause Pete wanted to have, you know, these angles where you would see a bunch of the water. Like, "You can't do it! Don't do it." He's like, "No, you've got to be able to see the water." And then we'd have like this, you know, three-quarters of the screen was just this undulating water. And they're big, you know, they're movies and they're big and awesome.
colx0206	Kevin: So there you can see some of the artifacts on the spotlight.
colx0207	Bret: Yeah.
colx0208	Kevin: Where it gets all bandy. That's just a--
colx0209	Bret: 16-bit, baby.
colx0210	Kevin: Yeah, a result of the video compression, and the water would do that.
colx0211	Bret: Yeah, you can see the frame rate on the background doesn't match, I think because we tried to make that one smaller. That lighthouse is just such a mess. We actually made it smaller. I think we ran at a lower frame just so we could actually fit it in memory.
colx0301	Tim: It goes from the super traumatic moment of the flowers and her death, and then all of a sudden there's this tongue on a card. The numbers are important, that's all I'm going to say. But "lengua"-- Around this time I went to a, um-- I remember going to a festival, a street festival. Carneval festival in The Mission. And drinking a lot of beer, and then I think the more drunk you are in the sunshine at a festival, the more likely you are to eat tongue tacos. That's my personal theory. So I ordered, um-- I was like, "What's a 'lengua'?" And they're like, "It's tongue." I was like, "Give it to me!" And it was delicious.
colx0302	Peter M: Of course it is!
colx0303	Tim: Super tender.
colx0304	Peter M: I was going to say... See, you're talking to the wrong guy.
colx0305	Tim: Delicious. I liked it so much that we put the "lengua" in here. So good. I recommend everyone eat some tongue.
colx0306	Peter M: Yeah, I mean be consistent here.
colx0307	Tim: It doesn't lick you back, if that's what you're worried about.
colx0308	Peter M: Exactly, and it's--
colx0309	Tim: You think it's going to be all tough, like your own tongue.
colx0310	Peter M: No, no.
colx0311	Tim: And you hate biting your own tongue, but...
colx0312	Peter M: No... There is a little bit of worry about biting someone else's tongue, that's true. There's something a little...
colx0313	Tim: Or that it's tasting you.
colx0314	Peter M: Yeah, yeah.
cohh0101	Alex: How big were those, when you drew them? Like the posters and the murals and stuff.
cohh0102	Paul: We could actually work rather big.
cohh0103	Dave: Did you have Photoshop back then?
cohh0104	Paul: We had Photoshop, but you... I don't know if we had layers back then.
cohh0105	Gaurav: Oh, we had layers.
cohh0106	Paul: We did-- Oh we had layers, but maybe only--
cohh0107	Dave: Paul just didn't know what they were.
cohh0108	Paul: No! But I think, too, you only had one undo, or maybe two undos.
cohh0109	Mark: Oh, wow.
cocn0101	Paul: Oh, wow! I forgot about that mural. That was supposed to be--
cocn0102	Alex: Wow, that's really good.
cocn0103	Paul: Oh, well, thank you. I did that.
cocn0104	Alex: Did you?
cocn0105	Paul: Uh, no I did. But it was based on, you know, like a Gustav Klimt. But then I also did those really bad textures on the roulette wheels, and uh...
cocn0106	Dave: Oh, they're fine.
cocn0107	Paul: Oh... But I remember Adam Schnitzer actually getting angry at me. He was like, "Don't paint light in the paintings."
cocn0108	Dave: Who got angry with you?
cocn0109	Paul: Oh, not really angry at me. He only--
cocn0110	Dave: It probably felt the same way as when Kim said, er, Tim said, "Manny's not cool enough sliding down the banister! Just make it cool... Canadian animator."
cocn0111	Paul: Heh, what's that aboot?
cocn0112	Dave: That's now so not cool.
cocn0201	Tim: Chowchilla Charlie.
cocn0202	Peter M: Oh, yes.
cocn0203	Tim: That name comes from an actual person I know who was from Chowchilla, which no one remembers anymore. But when I was a kid, an entire school bus full of children was kidnapped in the town of Chowchilla. Do you remember that? In California--
cocn0204	Peter M: No, wow.
cocn0205	Tim: A school bus full of kids was kidnapped, and the people demanded ransom. And it was crazy to think about. It was on the news, it was... Chowchilla, everyone was talking about these kids. And eventually they were found and rescued, and I don't believe they were hurt, so I can talk about that story now. And all the kids went home. But, um, and then years later I just, um, a friend of ours was dating this guy named Charlie, and he was from Chowchilla. And I was like, "Oh wow, were you on that bus?" He's like, "No, I was sick that day. I was sick, I didn't go to school that day, and so I didn't get kidnapped."
cocn0206	Peter M: Wow.
cocn0207	Tim: We always referred to him as "Chowchilla Charlie," and he's now in the game as Chowchilla Charlie, even though his personality is not as sleazy as this character. He's a fine, outstanding--although very lucky--guy.
cocn0208	Peter M: Yeah.
cocn0209	Tim: But this is our Peter Lorre character.
cocn0301	Peter M: Manny's music--the "Casino Calavera" music--is uh, that was a big moment for me doing the score because it was done fairly early on. And it kind of, it determined a lot of other stuff. Just sort of stylistically. Get that sort of Gene Krupa thing going on in the beginning, and--
cocn0302	Tim: Gene Krupa?
cocn0303	Peter M: Yeah, one of the great drummers of all time.
cocn0401	Tim: I always wanted to have a really international flare. I guess because "Casablanca" was very international, but I also love the game, "Last Express," the Jordan Mechner game. "Last Express": you're on a train and there's a lot of listening to conversations that are not presented at full volume, because you're eavesdropping. You're walking down the hallway and you hear someone talking in a room. But they would often be very quiet, but also sometimes in another language, like French, or German or something. And just the idea of, like, overhearing a quietly spoken French conversation was so neat in that game that we tried to have people talking in other languages in here. Like the croupier in the game where he's only speaking French, I believe.
cocf0101	Tim: So this is one of the parts, um, in the game that was very inspired by "Gilda." You ever seen "Gilda?" Um, I think Rita Hayworth.
cocf0102	Peter M: No.
cocf0103	Tim: Uh, it's a great noir movie--
cocf0104	Peter M: I'm just going to go home and see it now.
cocf0105	Tim: It's amazing, and it's the scene that you always see when they show Rita Hayworth, where she just flips her hair up and says, "Who, me?" Have you ever seen that...? So anyway, it's about a, um-- It's set in a resort town where there's a casino, and the main character... There is a... The main character's working in a casino and there's this kind of corrupt local law enforcement officer who shows up every night. And the way he gets paid off by the casino, to not bust it, is he always comes and bets on number two at a certain table. And then they always give him his money, and number two always wins and stuff. And so that, I think it's the same number in this game. We always use number two.
cocf0201	Peter M: When we leave the diner for the last time, there's a sort of a moment with the-- Just kind of a technical and sort of dramatic moment with the music where the radio, the music on the radio is playing and there's going to be a little bit of a cut and then there's-- You go to this cutscene music, which takes... It's supposed to be sort of a seamless break from the game music to the cutscene music. And then the music kind of comes out of the radio and it's not, doesn't sound like it's on a radio anymore. It's the music of people's, you know, dreams and wishes.
comx0101	Tim: Rubacava is named after a girl I knew in the fourth grade. Her last name was Rulbacava. There's a fun fact for you.
comx0102	Peter M: Wow.
comx0103	Tim: She's married now. Doesn't use it anymore, so I get to use it.
comx0104	Peter M: You're keeping it alive.
comx0105	Tim: Mm hm.
comg0101	Dave: How was the lighting handled on the characters in each environment?
comg0102	Dave: Does anybody remember that?
comg0103	Peter T: I think, uh, however we were able to set up a couple of lights. I think that was it.
comg0104	Paul: Yeah, because wasn't there some information, that you guys would take the set-- Because didn't we have to save a copy of our sets with, like, the key light and the fill. Or just-- I thought we would save a version of the very simple...
comg0105	Peter T: That's possible, yeah. As like a starting place, but I mean it was all very kind of rudimentary.
comg0106	Dave: And you had to be really strategic with, you know what is the best use of a minimal amount of lights to accommodate the character in the entire scene that he's got to be in.
comg0107	Peter T: There was no-- I mean for all this stuff, there was no road map or procedure for like, oh, this is how you do 3-D forests, or light characters. I mean we had to make everything up and solve every problem to get everything to happen pretty much in this-- So there's a lot of just on-the-fly, different people figuring stuff out per scene, how to make something work. And as a result, some things work better than others.
comg0201	Tim: Oh, Membrillo... My brother actually makes "membrillo," which is a quince jelly that you eat with cheese. "Membrillo" means quince. Why are you looking at me like that?
comg0202	Peter M: Sure doesn't sound like it.
comg0203	Tim: "Membrillo."
comg0204	Peter M: Ah, "membrillo!" That's different.
comg0205	Tim: Yeah. What did you think I said?
comg0206	Peter M: [laughter]
cohp0101	Tim: Here we're being very insensitive to claustrophobics. And French people. Probably would never do it today.
cohp0102	Peter M: Well, the Twitter-- Just think of the Twitter response from the claustrophobic French people, right?
cohp0103	Tim: Mm hm.
copc0101	Bret: Okay, I remember at the time it was a big debate. Like, "Should we require P100 or P133?" Like, Pentium 100, Pentium 133. It's like, "Nope, your target platform is whatever was on sale at CompUSA for five hundred bucks last year."
copc0102	Kevin: It's like a P70.
copc0103	Bret: Yeah, it's like what the-- You know P60 I think is what we ended up with as the minimum spec. We ended up going for P90 at the end. But it was one of those things where it's like those kind of constraints, where it's like you really could pull it off with all the kinds of machines we had in the company, but the average consumer who we wanted to sell the game to did not have a machine like that. That's one of the vagaries of the PC market that still persists.
copc0104	Kevin: Yeah, and you wouldn't, you know when you think about "Grim" you wouldn't necessarily think, but there's like all hand-coded assembly [programming language] rasterizers in here. There's hand-coded assembly blitters in here. Um, lots of, like, layout asset management. This was a-- This was a tricky game to optimize and to get running acceptably on the kind of machines that people were going to be running it on. But it doesn't come off like the same technical challenge as a "Jedi Knight" or something like that. And it wasn't.
copc0105	Bret: Different kind of technical challenge. Much more, kind of iterative.
copc0106	Kevin: It was really getting all this weird stuff happening at the same time.
copi0101	Dave: I always remember when finishing an animation, you know I'd show it to Pete [Tsaykel] or something, and he'd be like, "Yeah, that's cool." And then we'd always have to show it to Tim. And Tim's feedback... was interesting. He always-- I don't know whether he likes them, I never knew whether he liked something or not, but it always ended with some kind of joke, or sarcastic comment. Which was always fun.
copi0102	Paul: I remember one time showing Pete something. He said, "Well, I don't like it, but I don't know why." And... Which is the most helpful criticism that you can ever get, um, because you don't know how to fix the thing. But I'm being facetious.
copi0201	Tim: We wanted them to show-- Eventually, you're going to see him do a bee dance, which we were really proud to get. I had to actually do some dancing for the animators to get that to... be accurate as possible. 'cause you know when bees find pollen, or a bunch of flowers, they fly back to the hive and then they shake their abdomens in a certain way which tells people what-- It helps leads the other bees.
copi0202	Peter M: That's right, yeah.
copi0203	Tim: So when Terry is trying to lead the, um-- This right here, he's like trying to lead the other bees, and so he gives them a speech and then he shakes his abdomen a little bit to, uh, tell everybody where to go. Shake shake shake--I can do that dance really well.
cosi0101	Clint: One thing for a sound designer, for a composer. When the story is great and the writing is great, and the pacing is great--whether it's a film or a game--you can't help but weigh in in a successful way yourself because there is this flow already, and you're just participating with it and enhancing it. One of the jobs of a composer especially-- In a game like this, a lot of time passes and you need to entertain the listener and provide musical interest, but it has to also last for a very long time without being tiresome. And I think Pete did a great job at striking a balance between a great deal of musical interest but also kind of hanging back and taking its time and letting the story unfold. Letting the player concentrate on the game.
cosi0201	Tim: And uh, so that guy--Toto Santos, which is the name of the All Souls' Day--that was one important casting thing that meant so much at the time, and um, I love "The Usual Suspects."
cosi0202	Peter M: Yes.
cosi0203	Tim: There's a burn victim at the very beginning of the [film], a guy who was burned on a ship.
cosi0204	Peter M: Right.
cosi0205	Tim: And he's in the bed, and he's the first guy who says, "Keyser Sφze."
cosi0206	Peter M: Got it, right.
cosi0207	Tim: He's this Hungarian or Polish guy. And we got that actor to do Toto Santos's voice, 'cause I was like, "I want him to sound like that guy from 'The Usual Suspects!'" And so if you listen to him he's just--
cosi0208	Peter M: That's awesome.
cosi0209	Tim: I just, I wanted to have him say, "Keyser Sφze," in the game, but he doesn't.
cosi0301	Lleslle: I love how all the characters have very distinct voices that match their personality and their look. Like, how much would Tim give you direction and how much was your direction, um, influencing?
cosi0302	Darragh: Well, ideally when you go through the process you um, you know you have character pictures along with the audition copy and we would send that out to the various agencies, and the auditions would come back. It kind of, the process kind of does that for you because you're listening to the auditions and you're looking at the picture and you narrow it down to like, you know, a handful of candidates and then sort of, we'd sit down with Tim and... You know, just go through them and sometimes there's only one choice. You just know it.
cosi0303	Lleslle: Right. It's just so... great. All of them.
cosi0304	Darragh: What you do is you cast for like the major characters and then use that same talent pool with a lot of the smaller characters. And so that's why Kay [Kuter] is, you know he was cast for Velasco, but then the croupier just was one of those that's like, okay, well, that fits. He works.
cosi0305	Lleslle: So you let the actors pretty much kind of come up with their character as well, when they look at the picture?
cosi0306	Darragh: Yeah, yeah. Like for those secondary characters, they're totally undefined when you're in the studio and so you just kind of sit there, look at the picture... Look at the lines, talk about it, dial a voice in. And then go.
cosi0307	Lleslle: Yeah, just create... Ah, I love it! It's just creative everywhere, you know? Like through the whole thing. Not just with us but even with the actors and stuff like that. You really are like watching a movie. It's amazing.
cosi0308	Darragh: You really want that relationship between sort of the voice-over director and the actor to be collaborative and allow them the freedom to bring stuff to the table, and try things and, um, it just adds a lot.
cosl0101	Darragh: This is Pamela Segall, who plays Bobby on "King of the Hill." She's quite a character. She has a minivan with flames on the side.
cosl0102	Julian: Oh, yes.
cosl0103	Darragh: And a skull on the, uh, the front where it replaces-- I don't know what brand it is, but let's say it's Chrysler or somebody. And so instead of the Chrysler logo there's a skull and crossbones. She's pretty funny.
cosl0104	Julian: Did she just do this as one big long...?
cosl0105	Darragh: Yeah, all one take so she could build and build.
cosl0106	Julian: Yeah, yeah.
cosl0107	Darragh: You know, let it sort of ebb and flow.
cosl0108	Clint: And obviously, Pete's [McConnell] quotation of "There's No Place Like Home" is something we all admired in Carl Stalling, who did a lot of the compositions for the "Merrie Melodies" Looney Tunes cartoons. And any time, as you may know, that a chicken comes on screen or something it will play "Turkey in the Straw," or you know various public domain songs that were relevant to the subject of the moments, so she was reminiscing about home and Pete strikes up a--
cosl0109	Julian: That's really cool.
cosl0110	Clint: "There's No Place Like Home."
cosl0201	Tim: Her um, her character's a little bit inspired by, I think it's "Big Sleep" too, where Bogart is hiding from someone. He needs to hide in a book store.
cosl0202	Peter M: Right.
cosl0203	Tim: And he goes in there, and there's a woman in there and she's really into him.
cosl0204	Peter M: "Do you have a Ben Hur, 1863 edition, the one with the errata on page... 47 or something?"
cosl0205	Tim: Wow, that is a memory you have.
cosl0206	Peter M: Well...
cosl0207	Tim: And it's just really-- He just, he looks at her and he's like, um, she seems like she's really attracted to him, if I remember correctly. And he like takes off her glasses, he's like, "Yeah, okay." It's a really kind of messed up scene.
cosl0208	Peter M: Well, that's-- You know, that was the subtext of the noir film.
cosl0209	Tim: And then he pulled the shade.
cosl0210	Peter M: Hanky panky.
cosl0211	Tim: Yeah, the hanky panky. Yeah they lock the door and pull down the shades. And that's a little bit what this scene is a reference to, or inspired by.
cosl0212	Peter M: 'cause she's telling him her story.
cosl0213	Tim: Mm hm.
cogt0101	Clint: Speaking of database, I mean that was really how we accomplished so much, right? Is from an organizational standpoint of the music, of the sound effects, and of the voice. And I remember, especially for voice, how critical it was. And what we in the sound department would do is inherit and share the use of the database with the voice department, um, and you could do a search and isolate all the lines for, say, Manny, or isolate all the lines that needed to have reverb baked into them, or another type of processing. And then you would just divide and conquer, and just master everything in groups and bring it all together. Have single reference for volume. And uh, use the database to keep organized and isolate different found sets of different criteria.
cots0101	Tim: Strange, the characters in this game don't like to go into crowded areas, almost as if it's too hard to render them.
cobi0101	Bret: There's that spotlight.
cobi0102	Kevin: Mm hm. Yeah, so this was another like-- We lifted up the, er, took the technology from Renderdroid, which was in "Jedi Knight," but it didn't have spotlights at the time. It just had directional lights and point lights. So that was actually one of the very first things when, uh--
cobi0103	Bret: Yeah, that's the first thing you did.
cobi0104	Kevin: Yeah, when I got hired onto the team, which I was brand new to LucasArts, and uh, Tim and Bret brought me in and my first thing I was like, "I'm gonna put in spotlights, 'cause I know how to do that, and it's gonna matter, and uh, that'll be my stake in the ground." And this was one of the first scenes I worked on that had spotlights. So... when Manny walks off stage and you see the light, you know when he walks out of the light... That was a pretty important moment. Everybody thought that was pretty cool. I was like, alright, I did something. I'm in this amazing project with this amazing team and I did something.
cobi0201	Tim: And then, for some reason I was always really interested in beatniks. Beatniks and reds. I think it was so foreign to me, like the "Red Scare" was not part of my actual life, but it always seemed like-- This thing is, it's hard... It was always funny to me to imagine how passionate people were about that. How big of a deal--
cobi0202	Peter M: Oh yeah.
cobi0203	Tim: -- it was for them. And it was always... from a safe distance it was just kind of entertaining. Like, oh wow, people were really concerned about Communists everywhere and unions and...
cobi0204	Peter M: I remember there were--when I was a little kid there were-- people would still talk about Communist plots in all seriousness, yeah.
cobe0101	Paul: Oh and I'm sorry, Gaurav, this is the set that you had to build twice.
cobe0102	Mark: This is Gaurav's, right?
cobe0103	Gaurav: Yeah, this is the one.
cobe0104	Paul: This was the gift that kept on giving.
cobe0105	Dave: And it's actually very beautiful.
cobe0106	Paul: Yes! Well, a second time is...
cobe0107	Gaurav: Too kind. Yeah, the second time...
cobe0108	Paul: But I'm sorry, you were saying that that was a real building.
cobe0109	Gaurav: Yeah, yeah.
cobe0110	Paul: Where? Was that in Spain?
cobe0111	Gaurav: Uh, I think it's in Paris. I think. And I remember seeing a photo of it and being like, "Wait, Peter [Tsaykel]..."
cobe0112	Paul: Uh, nuh... Good artists borrow, great artists steal.
cobw0101	Paul: Oh, we definitely should give a huge shout-out to Peter Chan and-- Yeah, I'm still jealous of that guy.
cobw0102	Dave: "Chan the Man."
cobw0103	Paul: I know. Just when those packages [of concept art] would come it would just be like Christmas, and you'd open... Yeah you'd see those and you just think, "Aw man, and he's a nice guy, too," you know. Happy family--
cobw0104	Dave: The weird thing about that was I never experienced like the delivery of the package first-hand, but I still got excited about it.
cobw0105	Paul: Nah, they were beautiful. And he's such a sweetheart.
coci0101	Dave: I remember animating Manny sliding down the banister. And I remember Tim kept calling for something... "He's gotta look cool!" And so I did that, and I don't think he was ever really happy with it. So I don't know, apparently I don't know what "cool" means.
coci0102	Mark: Gotta put some Ray-Bans on him.
coci0103	Dave: Aw, yeah. I mean he's, Manny's a suave guy but I don't know if suave guys slide down banisters. Maybe I should have done it slower.
coci0201	Tim: You get a special award for playing the "Rusty Anchor" song.
coci0202	Peter M: I secretly wanted to be, to sing this one. I did a demo for you, remember?
coci0203	Tim: Yeah, this is one of the things--much like Cabbage Boy--that we wrote together. I wrote the lyrics and then you came up with a tune and then changed the lyrics a little bit to actually make them more musical... "My boat's got a rusty anchor..."
coci0204	Peter M: Yeah... "Oh, rusty anchor! Going down, down, down." See?
coci0205	Tim: Do it! "Oh, rusty anchor... [Guess I gotta] stink around." I said "stink around." It's "stick around."
coci0301	Tim: I wish you would slide down the banister because we put a lot of effort into sliding that banister.
coci0302	Tim: Come on, slide down the banister. I recommend any player who's in this room slide down the banister. It's much faster than walking.
coci0303	Peter M: Especially if you're six and you don't have terrible consequences when you hit the bottom.
coci0304	Tim: You should not try that at home. Actually, kids, you should. You should go slide down the banister of your house right now.
coci0305	Peter M: Everybody's gotta do it once!
cowc0101	Bret: So this is a-- This is one of the parts of the game where a huge amount was cut out. There was supposed to be a gigantic action sequence, like there was in all of-- You know, I think we cut a giant action sequence out of every year. But there was a gigantic action sequence where there was an animal called the "Dillopede" that guarded the bottom of the elevator. It was a giant armadillo. And the Dillopede was there to, uh, kind of snap at Manny as he came down. There's this whole sequence where you had to kind of, you know... You had the Dillopede hanging by some elevator cable and he was snapping at you, and you had to swing on him or something like that, and... It's just the idea of a giant, vicious armadillo still sticks with me, but it was one of those things where it's like, you look at the context of the game and it's an adventure game and the budget's short. We were already going to be a huge game. What purpose is this serving the game? So we had to cut a lot of stuff out like that, that just was really cool and fun to design but ultimately not critical to the game and was going to be really expensive.
#year3commentary	
cofh0101	Dave: Tim had the coolest office.
cofh0102	Mark: He did.
cofh0103	Dave: It was filled with, like, tiki lights and it felt like, it was like Christmas land. Not Christmasey, but... It gave you that same feeling of decoration and homeyness.
cofh0104	Alex: Yeah. I was going to say warmth. Yeah, homeyness. There was a couch in there which was always nice.
cofh0105	Dave: Yup. And I think I probably overstayed my welcome in there a few times.
cofh0106	Gaurav: I think we all probably did.
cofh0107	Mark: You never knew when you were, when you should leave 'cause it was so much fun in there, but then it's like, oh man, he has work to do.
cofh0108	Dave: Yeah, it's no wonder he had to work through the night. It's because we would--
cofh0109	Alex: We would bother him all the time.
cofh0110	Dave: His office was like going to Disneyland and you'll just sit in there and talk on the couch and just want to be a part of this... uh... this creation.
cofh0111	Alex: He had some old game consoles in there, and I would go and talk classic games with him 'cause he knew that I was an enthusiast as well. So that was fun.
cofh0112	Mark: I think he should have made his office more boring.
cofh0113	Dave: He did spend a lot of time in that office.
cofh0114	Alex: How's his office now?
cofh0115	Dave: I've seen pictures. I think it's pretty cool.
cofh0116	Mark: It's pretty cool. It's like a grown-up version of that office, maybe. He's still got all his Rubik's Cubes on his desk.
cofh0117	Paul: Oh, I forgot about the--
cofh0118	Dave: I forgot he was a master of the Rubik's Cube.
cofh0119	Mark: He is.
cofh0120	Alex: Really?
cofh0121	Mark: Yes. Don't challenge him.
cofh0122	Alex: Well, I would never.
cofo0101	Tim: Mm hm. I always thought it was because they're so cute, I just had to, um, be mean to them. Like once, when my sister got her tonsils taken out, she had big puffy cheeks. I remember my aunt came to visit and she goes, "Oh, you look so cute! I just want to be mean to you!" And I never really understood it until I, we had these little baby angels in the game. I just, "Ooh, I just, wanna just terrorize them!" So you can get out your scythe and scare them and do all these horrible things.
cofo0102	Peter M: It's the Mr. Bill--
cofo0103	Tim: It's a little sick.
cofo0104	Peter M: It's the Mr. Hands in all of us.
cofo0201	Tim: "Angelitos" is actually, um... The little children in the cage, comes from a term that-- It was a popular kind of, um... Well, it was traditional in Mexico to take pictures of your children, even if they died very young. Like, photography of little dead children.
cofo0202	Peter M: It's a old genre, yeah.
cofo0203	Tim: I don't know if that happened in the States, but it was definitely in Mexico.
cofo0204	Peter M: Mexico, yeah. I've seen those. I think you showed them to me, actually.
cofo0205	Tim: And the word they use for children when they-- When they're young, when they died is "angelitos."
cofo0206	Peter M: Oh, yeah.
cofo0207	Tim: It's a dark, dark game.
cofo0208	Peter M: It is dark.
cocy0101	Tim: God, this is where people-- Nowadays it would be like, "Tim, the ideas you have here about this conveyor belt where they can switch directions and rip those chains with a scoop is really complicated, and we could eliminate a lot of work if we just cut this one puzzle." But it's just like, no, we went all the way and we fully implemented exactly what I hoped would happen. The conveyor belt would reverse direction, chain would go up and down, Manny would climb down and against the force of water, bunch up the chain. This is all so complicated. Oh, and you create a little loop. I was like, "This all makes sense in my mind, so the player will be able to figure this out." Like the way that you looped it over that, um, boat. I don't even know if that would work. That's like when you whip a hose to like get it uncaught, when you're watering the plants in the backyard. Your hose gets caught.
cocy0102	Peter M: Right, right, yup. And it did a little whiplash effect, yeah.
cocv0101	Kevin: So one of the things that was super-- Another technical problem that was really interesting was the save/load, 'cause I wanted to cut a bunch of corners on save/load to just make it a little easier to implement. And we had talked about things like you could only save and load, or when you load it would load at the beginning of a room and back up content a little bit. Or just do it where it was a little bit more convenient. And Tim really wanted a really high-fidelity save/load. I remember trying to talk him out of it and he threw the gauntlet down. He was like, "If Manny is in the middle of a line and there's a puff of smoke hanging in the air, then, and I hit save, when he restores he should pick up from the middle of that line where he was at and that puff of smoke should be in the air." And I was like, "Alright, man, if that's what you want that's what you're gonna get." And uh, it was a big pain. It took a lot of work to get it there. But that's the way the game shipped and that's kind of, you know, with controls and things like that, Tim was pretty uncompromising and had a vision of what he wanted this thing to be. And, you know, as much as we were able we gave him what he wanted.
cocu0101	Tim: Now this, all that water was running in the "Rebel Assault" engine. The game is running in the "Jedi Knight" engine, and the, uh--
cocu0102	Peter M: Oh, that's right!
cocu0103	Tim: All the streaming video is from the "Rebel Assault" engine.
cocu0104	Peter M: "... Assault" engine, that is right!"
cocu0105	Tim: So we're compositing the "Rebel Assault" technology on top of "Jedi Knight" technology, and then all the Lua scripting for the gameplay is what comprised the GrimE engine, which we never actually called the GrimE engine at the time but Bret wanted to call it the GrimE engine. It's like, "Grim."
cocu0106	Peter M: Oh, that's funny.
cocu0107	Tim: And later he's been able to do enough interviews where he's called it the GrimE engine, that people just call it the GrimE engine. Now that's fine, it should have a name.
cocu0108	Peter M: Everything should, yeah.
cocu0201	Tim: Those look like my sister's curling iron.
cocu0202	Peter M: I was just going to say, those things always scared me. They're truly terrifying, those--
cocu0203	Tim: The curling iron?
cocu0204	Peter M: Those grinder-- No, the--
cocu0205	Tim: Oh, the grinders.
cocu0206	Peter M: The grinders. The curling irons, to a lesser degree.
cocu0207	Tim: Those are based on my sister's curling iron. No, you don't call them curling irons. Curlers! Based on my sister's curlers.
cocu0208	Peter M: Curlers, right.
cocu0209	Tim: And my terrible fear of curlers.
cocu0210	Peter M: They're fearsome things.
cosu0101	Peter M: The um, the sort of whale sounds in the music are, um, overblowing on the contrabass clarinet.
cosu0102	Tim: Oh yeah. [whale noise]
cosu0103	Peter M: Yeah, Ralph Carney doing his little-- Same thing with the birds that jump up at you and surprise you and squawk.
cosu0201	Tim: So he's been-- This is like a play on moth navigation. Like they say that moths fly into lights 'cause they're used to using the moon for navigation, and they're not used to electric lights. And so he's, um, used to using the moon for navigation but he's been distracted by this thing called The Pearl. And it's made him march in circles all these years.
covd0101	Dave: Are the three stripes on the back of Manny's head, is that hair?
covd0102	Peter T: No, it's just a lazy, lazy design element to match the front of his head.
covd0103	Dave: Oh and the tops of his hands, remember? There's little stripes on there, too.
covd0104	Mark: Day of the Dead decorations, right?
covd0105	Peter T: Yeah.
covd0106	Dave: I never knew what it was, I just thought it was cool.
covd0107	Peter T: It's an Adidas homage.
coew0101	Gaurav: So this whole environment I think was worked on around the end of the game and we had to bring in a few other artists on at the end in order to get it all done.
coew0102	Paul: Yeah. I kind of remember that, towards the end, 'cause it was just like a skeleton crew. The budget had gotten so big that I just remember Pete [Tsaykel] and a few other people working on it for a couple of months or something, while all of us had to move on to other projects.
colu0101	Peter M: So once in a while, if there was a solo part that we could, um, get to be recorded by a real person, we would do that. But um, I don't know if you remember, we were kind of under a lot of schedule pressure with that.
colu0102	Tim: I do remember some--
colu0103	Peter M: And people were like--
colu0104	Tim: One late night or two. There was a late night or two.
colu0105	Peter M: And then there was like, "You're spending thirteen thousand dollars on live musicians!? Are you crazy?" So we were lucky we could do what we could do at all, but...
colu0106	Tim: And look, where are those guys today? I don't even remember their names, and here we are talking about "Grim."
colu0107	Peter M: Exactly.
colu0108	Tim: Those guys are all dead. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I meant I hope they're dead.
colu0109	Tim: I hope they're happy, spending time with their families, and no longer working on games.
colu0110	Tim: Which I think actually is true.
colu0201	Mark: It's hard to make them kiss 'cause they have those--
colu0202	Alex: They don't have lips.
colu0203	Dave: They should've added like a [knock sound], like a knocking sound.
colu0204	Alex: Oh, that would've been funny.
colu0205	Mark: Bones kissing.
colu0206	Dave: Yeah, making out. Imagine what that sounds like with a bony face.
colz0101	Bret: We stole a lot of the really good things out of SCUMM and kept them. We kept the idea of the chore tool, which I just call CHORTLE, but they had CYST and BILE and all these bodily humor-flavored tools from SCUMM. CYST, BILE, FLEM, MMUCUS, and we kept-- But the, there are analogues, like the chore tool is the really big one, but it's the analogue to what they did in CYST which was the costume editor for all the other adventure games. And we kept those paradigms, you know they manipulate 3-D elements and 2-D elements and movies and things together on one timeline, but that really is harkening back to exactly what they were doing in 2-D games.
colz0102	Kevin: Lucas[Arts] is remembered for the great art and the funny writing and all of that, but it's all built on--
colz0103	Bret: Yeah, it's good tech.
colz0104	Kevin: Just amazing tech.
codp0101	Tim: One weird trivia fact about the world that I learned, I was um, I saw a couple of Manny Calavera tattoos when I was at PAX. And someone asked me, "Why are there no Glottis tattoos?" I started Googling and I couldn't find a single Glottis tattoo on the Internet. I found many Manny tattoos. And so I don't know why Glottis-- I'll just say that on the Internet tomorrow.
codp0102	Peter M: That there need to be more Glottis tattoos, I agree with that.
codr0101	Peter M: I was gonna say about the music, where he reveals the whole big conspiracy theory, that was a jam between the cello player and the, um, the contrabass clarinet player.
codr0102	Tim: Oh yeah.
codr0103	Peter M: Basically, the idea was that since it's a whole complicated conspiracy, that they would just jam and jam forever on the same theme, kind of weaving it out.
codr0104	Tim: Mm hm.
codr0201	Tim: You can't hear what he's listening-- What is Domino listening to on his headphones, in your mind?
codr0202	Peter M: Oh, he's li-- It's not just what he's--
codr0203	Tim: You can actually hear like a little--
codr0204	Peter M: He's listening to his own theme, and it's done as a headphone-- We mixed it so it would sound like headphones. It's very quiet, but he's listening to his own music.
coac0101	Dave: One thing that was a little weird animating all this underwater stuff: when you animated a little section like Manny jumping off the conveyor belt, or climbing up a chain, or getting dragged along by a boat or whatever, you would always try to add that element of the physics of being underwater. And then seeing the harsh contrast of when you're back in interactive mode and we're still using the same animation of him walking above water, it was hard for an animator to get over that. These little things you can't let go of.
coac0102	Mark: You would have had to do a whole new set of anims, like...
coac0103	Dave: And that, well, the other thing is we may not have, that may not have been the... The thing that would've stopped something like that. It could've even been, like... There would be too much code required to switch a system or something. Like, who knows what the reason was.
coei0101	Clint: Thinking back to the way that we all worked together at LucasArts. You know, the way the different departments collaborated. You know, it was-- Everybody just assumed that we were all rooting for each other and on the same team, and there was almost no sense of kind of trial period or-- Nowadays, and for a long time now in the video game industry, a lot of times when you are in a service capacity, such as sound or audio/music, uh, there's really a vetting period where what you're presenting is being vetted by the directors and producers and you need to hear back. What did they think? Are they going to want to continue to work with us, and that kind of thing. And that's fine. It's the way the film industry is, that's the way things are. But back then, especially at LucasArts, it was not at all like that. Everyone just wanted to be working together. It was all one team. Everyone was facing in the same collaborative direction and achieving fun results. I think that creates an atmosphere in which people feel comfortable creating and taking risks. So it paid off, I think.
cogh0101	Dave: I remember being really-- See how their hands kind of clip through their sleeves? I remember being really annoyed by that, as an animator. Having to settle to do it 'cause you just, you couldn't get the poses and the lines you needed... uh... without making things kind of collide. It's something we just had to kind of live with.
cogh0102	Peter T: And something we still live with today.
cogh0201	Mark: So that chain that's holding the ship. At one point we had to add joints to that because I think at one point it's animated. And it kept crashing and we couldn't figure out why, and we eventually figured out that you couldn't have more than ninety-nine joints in a rig in Softimage at that point. It had like a hundred joints or something.
cogh0202	Paul: No, but again it's this funny thing when people maybe see this stuff and they think of movies now that maybe look better, but we were having to deal with a lot of limitations.
cogh0203	Dave: I'm actually really, really excited to see the Remastered version because, you know, you look at elements of this game that was made over fifteen years ago and visually it still kind of holds up to games that you can see today. So I'm curious about what it's going to look like after Double Fine gets finished with it. I think it'd be pretty special.
covi0101	Darragh: It's funny, the casting of Manny was... It was tough because... Obviously you have-- I wanted to hire somebody who was legitimately Hispanic, and not somebody putting on a fake accent.
covi0102	Julian: Oh, for sure.
covi0103	Darragh: And normally in sort of the casting process you'd sit down with the project leader. You'd probably have five to ten candidates that you'd be looking at, and with Manny we had two. And Tony was more Humphrey Bogart and the actor was more comedic, and I was terrified that Tim was going to go the comedic route because I thought Tony was the guy. I remember printing out rιsumιs for the two guys and Tony had a lot more experience. Then there was a really cool picture of Tony taken from Havana where he's sitting up at the bar, and he just looked cool. I made sure that went in, too, just to help kind of push it in the direction I wanted it to go.
covi0104	Julian: And it's just, it's the perfect voice.
covi0105	Darragh: Yeah, yeah, he's great.
covo0101	Tim: There was a-- The elevator in my dorm that you could... push open while it was moving. You push the gate open, it freezes it in between floors, and hang out in the elevator for no reason. But there was a little, like a little, like, strip of metal up in the corner that that door would plug into when it was closed to know that it was closed. And we tried to get the elevator moving with the door open by sticking-- We're sticking our fingers in this thing, trying to trigger the little switch. I totally got electrocuted because it was like a live, actual electrical current in there.
covo0102	Peter M: Yeah, ouch!
covo0103	Tim: So that's where that comes from. That little door closing thing.
covo0104	Peter M: From ill-advised college activities?
covo0105	Tim: Ill-advised, drunken college dorm elevator near-death pranks.
cobl0101	Dave: The animation team was very green and we were lucky to work under people like Pete [Tsaykel] and some other senior folks on the team, like Eric Ingerson and Mark Hamer. We came out of school learning traditionally 2-D animation and probably had about a month or two of work on "Monkey Island 3," I think, which was still semi-traditional. And then this was our first kind of interaction with the 3-D and computers and we struggled. We watched Eric do the most complex things you can imagine.
cobl0102	Peter T: It was all very new. I think we had a couple of consulting sessions. This was back when we were still kind of connected to ILM, and so we had Kyle Balda who's a, was a LucasArts alum, and at the time worked at ILM. He came over and gave us some 3-D pointers. At a couple of points we had some special private sessions.
coop0101	Dave: Oh, I wanted to also talk about-- I think this was, this may have been the first game, it may not have, but at LucasArts that I can remember, where you walk the character around and procedurally his head, Manny's head is turning towards--
coop0102	Paul: Oh, right.
coop0103	Dave: -- points of interest.
coop0104	Mark: Yeah.
coop0105	Dave: Procedurally!
coop0106	Mark: It was the first head tracking, right, at LucasArts?
coop0107	Dave: With a computer!
coop0108	Alex: Oh, definitely at LucasArts it was, for sure.
coop0109	Mark: I think that was because Tim didn't want to have like the UI highlighting stuff, right? Or he wanted to try something new.
coop0110	Dave: Yeah, it was partial hint and partial probably red herring, right?
coop0111	Mark: Oh.
coop0112	Dave: Like just show the player that they're in, point them in the direction of interesting subjects in the environment.
coop0113	Alex: And I mean, it shows you everything you can interact with, and not everything you can interact with is a solution, either.
coop0114	Peter T: There's no UI in this game, if anyone didn't notice, and that was by design.
coar0101	Peter M: I love the pulling the stocking down, and the leg bone being sexy. That's awesome.
coar0102	Tim: Our one cover image. Was it like a magazine? PC Games magazine, that image.
coar0103	Peter M: Oh yeah, I remember.
coar0104	Tim: But what is that from? This is definitely a reference to "Popeye."
coar0105	Peter M: And also, "Go ahead and scratch," right?
coar0106	Tim: What's "go ahead and scratch"?
coar0107	Peter M: When Humphrey Bogart, in "Maltese Falcon"--sorry, not "Maltese...", "Big Sleep." Humphrey Bogart is meeting-- Lauren Bacall comes into his office and she sits on his desk, and she crosses her legs, and she's scratching her knee. And the camera is showing you this from a interesting angle, right? Then she sees that he's looking at her scratching her knee and she covers her knee with her dress. He says, "Go ahead and scratch."
coar0108	Tim: "Go ahead and scratch." Um, I was thinking more of "Popeye." Olive Oyl falls into cement and she steps out of cement and everyone's whistling at her 'cause she has shapely legs and the cement falls away and she has Olive Oyl legs.
coar0109	Peter M: Oh I forgot that.
coar0110	Tim: That's what I always think of when I think of this scene.
coar0111	Peter M: There it is.
coar0201	Kevin: Yeah, so people, you know, a lot of people may know this already, but for those that don't: the game is just a big pre-rendered picture. There's no 3-D geometry in the game that describes the walls and the doors and the tables and all the props that are in the game. That's just a picture, a painting that's drawn in the background. So somebody had to go in manually and kind of make what we call walk boxes, but they're in 3-D space. They're like a little model that just describes, in 3-D space, where the, where Manny's allowed to walk. And if you turn the background off they just look like they're floating in space. There's nothing there. And there's boxes for walking, there's boxes for shadows, there's boxes for triggers that trigger, like, footstep sounds and things like that. But yeah, the image you see on the screen when you're playing the game, there is no real geometry there, so getting the illusion that Manny can walk in between tables and bounce off of walls and things like that is all smoke and mirrors.
coar0301	Peter M: See, I like that you still are not quite sure about Meche.
coar0302	Tim: That happens a lot in those noir movies.
coar0303	Peter M: Totally, it's just like--
coar0304	Tim: The woman is like, wait, is she in leagues with the bad guy, or is she being controlled and being blackmailed by the bad guy?
coar0305	Peter M: Yes. A testament to the fact that they're written by men.
coar0306	Tim: Ha ha ha ha ha... nervous laughter.
coil0101	Tim: Oh no, all the sprouted sailors. But what happens to their souls when they're sprouted?
coil0102	Peter M: I was wondering that myself.
coil0103	Tim: I think the idea was that they take the flowers and bring them back to the Land of the Living. They, like, get recycled.
coil0104	Peter M: Ah, they--
coil0105	Tim: I never really thought it through.
coil0106	Peter M: -- they get reincarnated which is sort of what you don't wanna do, if you're [dead].
comn0101	Kevin: One of the things with Manny's head and the look-at stuff was, um, it really meant that you couldn't put a lot of inventory items very close to each other, or limited the number of things in a room because even though you could toggle through and he would look at things kind of in sequence, it could get tricky if you put like three things on a table. Is he looking at thing number one, thing number two, or thing number three? So that was an interesting thing 'cause Lucas[Arts] was known for these adventure games with very dense-- Yeah, lots of things to click on in the screen. And you really couldn't do that here, but the game doesn't really feel lacking for it.
comn0102	Bret: I feel like that's filled in with dialogue. I mean ultimately you'd have those hunt-the-pixel games, you'd have a million things and you'd have to have one line for each thing. And with this one it's more like there are fewer things but there's more to say about each one, or more context or Manny kind of thinking to himself about things. It's a little more ruminating. So I think it adds to the character, just in terms of how much you kind of understand Manny or empathize with him.
comn0201	Lleslle: And do you remember the "Jesus bug?"
comn0202	Clint: No.
comn0203	Lleslle: The one where, when Manny would come on the water and he would float around, all over the screen? And so it would just randomly show up. And that was this bug that could not be squashed, that we think we'd kill and it'd come back. And talking about just trying to get it done, right? We were around the clock, it was towards the end. And literally we were, some of us were sleeping there and Bret Mogilefsky was working around the clock. And finally it was Tim, Steve Dauterman, myself, and then Bret's like, "I gotta go home now. I'm gonna go home now and they're going to test the new build." You know, and I was like, "Okay, go home. Get some sleep." It was like two or three in the morning. And then he just got home, and the "Jesus bug" came back.
comn0204	Clint: Ohh.
comn0205	Lleslle: Yeah! And then we were sitting in Steve Dauterman's office. And then I was on the couch and we were like, "Well, who's gonna call Bret?" And Steve looks at me and he's like, "You're the production manager." And it was like, oh gah!
comn0206	Clint: "Hey Bret, how's it going?"
comn0207	Lleslle: I know. "Hey, hi, can you come back? Thanks!"
comn0301	Tim: Reciprocating chisel... This scene is kind of actually right out of "The Fountainhead," this really-- Um, I think it's, is it Gary Cooper, or um... someone like that. And he's doing this super manly, like, drilling into this wall and the love interest of it comes over and is watching him, getting all aroused in a kind of a nineteen-thirties kind of way. And she's so mad that she's like-- She's out riding her horse and she slaps her riding crop onto her leg, show[s] her frustration. It's this hilarious scene. But for some reason I really like this jackhammer that he's just going into this wall with. And so it's here in a very similar erotic content here between Manny and Chepito.
comn0302	Peter M: Yeah, it's like I can see the... I can see the brotherly love.
cops0101	Dave: I wanted to point out that this octopus that we're seeing underwater was, I think, one of the things that Eric Ingerson took on.
cops0102	Mark: I was gonna say that, yeah.
cops0103	Dave: And it is-- That, back in 1997, that's probably like an animator's worst nightmare right there, I think. Trying to animate all those tentacles and not having a really intricate rig to work and keep all the curves in the arms. I'm not quite sure if Eric animated the tentacles frame-by-frame and bone-by-bone. I think he may have actually spent more time working on a rig to get what he wanted than he did animating.
cops0104	Mark: Yeah, he definitely set that character up, and he worked on that animal. And I think he did the spiders too, weren't we saying?
cops0105	Dave: I think Chris Schultz did some of that.
cops0106	Mark: Oh, Chris Schultz did the spiders.
cops0107	Dave: He may have rigged it, maybe.
cops0108	Mark: But Eric, he was really good at rigging and setting up the really complicated characters so that they would animate well.
cops0109	Dave: I think I remember Chris Schultz having some kind of elation going on when he got the spider rig 'cause he thought it was cool the way it worked.
cops0201	Kevin: You know, Tim's really into black velvet.
cops0202	Bret: Yeah.
cops0203	Kevin: And when I showed up my first day at work, there was a black velvet... kind of canvas, I don't know what it was. It was like this kind of like, you'd win it at the fair kind of thing. And it was like the grim reaper on a motorcycle with Mount Fuji in the background with these eagles flying out of it. And it was just pinned to the wall above my desk on the project. And for the entire project we really didn't talk much about it. It was just kind of there. And then when I moved on to the next project after it, I left my desk exactly the way I had found it, with the thing pinned up to the wall and the whole thing. And then Tim came and gave it to me. I still have it in my office right now. But he was like, "That's the mural that binds together 'Full Throttle' and 'Grim Fandango'--
cops0204	Bret: Interesting.
cops0205	Kevin: "--because it's the grim reaper on a motorcycle."
coea0101	Tim: And this is the part of the game I feel like it a lot more inspired by, actually, "City of Lost Children."
coea0102	Peter M: --"Children," yeah, right.
coea0103	Tim: That came out around that time, had a big influence on us. I think that's why we have a marching underwater diver, too. Like there's a lot of scenes in "City of Lost Children" where there's a diver just marching on the floor of the ocean, and it just seemed so dramatic and just he made this slow and steady pace, like... Slow and steady progress, but he was so heavy, and... and thick.
coea0104	Peter M: No flying fleas, though.
coea0105	Tim: No flying fleas.
cobu0101	Dave: I can't even imagine what was going through [Tim's] head at this point 'cause just the size of this game... Being able to absorb it all before it's realized.
cobu0102	Mark: He always had a really good idea of where we were and what was going on. And we were talking earlier about how there really wasn't a schedule that I remember, an art schedule for this game. It almost seemed like we just all sort of chose tasks and then we had Lleslle [Schroeder] sort of following up to make sure that we were... Doing them in about as much time as they should take, or not getting bogged down or stuck.
#year4commentary	
cosi0401	Dave: I have to say, coming out of school I felt super lucky to first of all be hired by LucasArts, by some colleagues of mine who went to the same school. And to walk into this building and see all the concept art for this game on the walls, I was like a kid in a candy store. It was instant euphoric inspiration. And um, I just felt like the luckiest guy in the world coming out of school, getting to work on a project of this caliber. It was beautiful.
colx0401	Tim: Yeah, the sprouting came later. It was like a solution to a problem we were having narratively with the game, which is like how do you make anything matter in the Land of the Dead? Like if you're going up against mobsters in a movie, usually you're afraid they're going to kill you or someone you love, right? Or break your thumbs. And in the Land of the Dead, who cares, you're dead, right? So we're like, "How do you kill people in the Land of the Dead?" And so we wanted to have it be that you were essentially brought back to life, like it went the other direction. You were returned to flowers. Um, and then flowers become this symbol of death in a weird way in the Land of the Dead. But flowers are such a huge part of the Day of the Dead, like the marigolds that you use in the Day of the Dead celebration, and the smell of marigolds are like a big part of the ceremony, so it was nice to have them be part of the game, too. And then the end of the game we wanted to have this thing called "the meadow," which was just full of flowers, which hopefully by that time would just look like death to you.
colm0201	Peter M: Tim, how come you know so much about neurosis and psychosis? Really...
colm0202	Tim: I don't know if--
colm0203	Peter M: It's quite striking.
colm0204	Tim: I don't know if any of this is legitimate psychological knowledge, or just what I learned from movies.
colm0205	Peter M: Well, speaking as sort of a crazy guy myself, it rings true to me.
cosd0301	Bret: Actually, I think it was funny when you came in and you were all excited about working on this game like, "I really like adventure games! I wanna do this kind of thing, I worked on all my own games." And I think about TellTale and it's like, okay, yeah that's pretty much in keeping. This was a long time ago, but I remember when you came in your game that you had worked on was like a helicopter game...?
cosd0302	Kevin: "Helicops!" Yes.
cosd0303	Bret: And it was like, as far different from this as you could possibly imagine a game would be, and I would not have imagined that a person who worked on "Helicops" was actually interested in adventure games.
cosd0304	Kevin: There weren't any games like this. All I wanted to do was play with little people in computers and I had gotten to the point where I almost ended up working on a baseball game 'cause that was the closest thing I could find to little people in computers. Um, and that's when I saw this. I was just like, it doesn't matter. I have to work on this.
coxb0101	Tim: Someone told me, like, this was the moment [when] they cried in the game. Just hearing how scared Glottis was in this scene, 'cause he gets really frightened. And it's actually a reference to a claim that a babysitter made about me when they were babysitting me. They said, "Oh, gee, you were so scared when your parents-- You would sit there and you'd say, 'Mother, mother, I'm frightened!'" And I was like, "No, okay first of all I never said that. I never said 'mother.'"
coxb0102	Peter M: Yeah, that's suspicious right there.
coxb0103	Tim: But it got to be this family joke. "Mother, I'm frightened! I'm frightened, mother!" And so that line actually got in the game.
cohb0101	Bret: Well I think it's one of the real challenges for adventure games because so many things you make for an adventure game are single use. Like single use animation, single use scenes, single use textures. They're all like, you do a first-person shooter, or you do, you know, adventure ga-- Oh, sorry, like a platformer or something like that. There are so many animations that get re-used so many times throughout the whole game, in an adventure game a huge amount of it is custom throwaway meant to be seen once or twice and occasionally all the time like walk cycles. But, you know it's not like "Mario." You know at the time they were doing "Mario 64" and it's like Mario has, you know, a ridiculous number of animations but it's a finite set and it's like they can all be loaded at all times. In this game, you have to dynamically load all the animations as they're needed, you have to make sure they're available before their triggers so you don't get these glitches while you wait for them. And a lot of them are just, they're thrown away. Every single one has to be individually processed by a human to get them into the game and potentially rigged up. And that's one of the challenges of making adventure games, is that you have all these sort of custom things and you want to reuse them as much as possible but in order to do that you have to automate a lot of stuff. Automate as much processing as you can. But you still have to have that ability to fix things. You know, in film, "We'll fix it in post." It's the same kind of thing. It's like, "We'll fix it in the engine. We'll fix it in the tool." As opposed to, "We'll fix it in the source art."
cohb0102	Kevin: And that's the uh, you know, like, you could walk to any room you want, and like all the little one-off assets? I think that's a unique challenge, technically, to adventure games that a lot of other games... Other genres don't really have to address. We're constantly loading in custom stuff and kicking custom stuff out, and on this game memory is tight. You walk into this room and we need sixteen-bit flipbooks of doors opening and closing, and one-off animations of "you may go and play the piano," "you may not go and play the piano." And there's all this technical kind of tomfoolery going on of trying to get the content that may be, that somebody-- Might be used, might not be used. You might just be running through this room to some other room. And it's not like loading up a level in a first-person shooter where you're like, "Okay, I-- I know what's going to be in front of the user at any one point in time. And we're going to use the same bad guy fifty times, over-- So I just need to get the stuff to run the bad guy in memory." This was a constant dance of like, just in time loading and management of stuff... because, uh... You could walk into this room and spend ten minutes in this room and explore every bit of content that this room could offer you, or you could just be running through on your way to somewhere else.
cohb0103	Bret: Back to this other puzzle.
cohb0104	Kevin: Yep.
cohb0105	Bret: Yeah.
cobk0201	Alex: I remember some trickle-down drama, from upstairs, in the test pit towards the end where things didn't seem to be getting done as fast as... whomever wanted them to be getting done, you know? And I just remember, like, there was some question as to whether or not we'd have to cut a bunch of scenes or even a whole year from the game, or something, because stuff wasn't coming in.
cobk0202	Dave: That was terrifying.
cobk0203	Alex: Yeah.
cobi0301	Darragh: But it was great. I mean, "Grim" is definitely still sort of the most satisfying project I think I've ever worked on. It was, it was just a lot of fun and um... You know, Cuban actors, American actors, Irish actors. A guy from Hungary. You know just all over the place, just--
cobi0302	Julian: Yeah.
cobi0303	Darragh: Bring that sort of diversity to it.
cobw0201	Paul: I think I offended Tim once when I said, "Tim, you should write scripts for movies! This is such a great idea." And Tim said, "I... I make video games. I wanna make video games. Why are you telling me to do something different?" And... I felt bad.
cobw0202	Dave: You cried that time?
cobw0203	Paul: I-- No, I only cry at night. Late at night. But--
cobw0204	Dave: Tim was often at the office at night time. I remember him--
cobw0205	Paul: Oh, yes.
cobw0206	Dave: -- locking his office door, and me trying to peak in between the curtains he laid over top of the glass. And he would be in there for days.
cobw0207	Paul: Wow... Yes.
cobw0208	Dave: When he finally got down to doing the dialogue stuff, I remember that. It was always like a pressure valve that blew on him at one time or another. And he would just lock himself in and... churn out this... amazing dialogue.
cobw0209	Paul: No, I mean I think Tim was a very intimidating person try and-- To try and be funny around Tim was hard 'cause he was so funny, and I never felt like I kind of rose to--
cobw0210	Dave: I relied on my funny Canadianness.
cobw0211	Paul: Right.
cobw0212	Dave: And my looks. That was enough.
cobw0213	Paul: I think it was, yes. Your biting wit.
cobw0214	Dave: I think I bested him one time with a facial expression that was not intentional.
cobw0215	Paul: What was the expression? Can you do it for the people on the commentary?
cobw0216	Dave: You'll see it in the game, if you look hard enough.
cobw0217	Paul: Good Lord!
cobw0218	Alex: Amazing.
cojb0101	Tim: I don't know if people agree with me. That was my idea of-- What do they call something that makes you barf? Something you take.
cojb0102	Peter M: Uh, expectorant?
cojb0103	Tim: No no, not expectorant... Ipecac! Ipecac.
cojb0104	Peter M: Ipecac, that's the syrup.
cojb0105	Tim: Like a verbal ipecac. Manny talks about the stuff they pack canned hams in, 'cause it's always grossed me out. That weird gelatin. Everyone would have a different thing that they'd bring up that would make them barf.
cojb0106	Peter M: Right, right.
cojb0107	Tim: What's yours?
cojb0108	Peter M: Ipecac is... ipecac. Sounds like that you do when you eat it.
cojb0109	Tim: You ipecac. I don't know how players are supposed to figure out this puzzle. That you had to fill the floor with regurgitated gelatin. It's not the first thing that jumps into people's minds. Where the hell you'd get that--
cojb0110	Peter M: I forgot that--
cojb0111	Tim: -- liquid nitrogen?
cojb0112	Peter M: I thought there was, I forgot that there was a regurgitated gelatin puzzle in the game. That's a standard thing, right?
cojb0113	Tim: Mm hm.
cojb0201	Darragh: Yeah, this is Alan Blumenfeld, who really brought a lot of heart to Glottis.
cojb0202	Julian: Yeah, totally.
cojb0203	Darragh: He's just a... a real sweetheart.
cojb0204	Lleslle: Oh yeah.
coth0101	Dave: One of the cool things about this game, too, is that there's a few characters that actually went through costume changes throughout the... the game, which was a nice detail.
coth0102	Paul: No, and it really gives you a sense of time, uh, time passing.
coth0201	Kevin: You know, this was a real boundary-pushing, from an adventure game genre point of view. And I was making the joke earlier that it's like if everyone isn't claiming that you're ruining adventure games, you're not making adventure an adventure game because...
coth0202	Bret: The grand heritage has to be insulted by every new-- Every new thing you do in adventure games has to be an insult to all adventure games before it. "How dare you innovate!"
coth0203	Kevin: But like, the controls on this one were-- Oh, so controversial. The controls were terrible and we're killing adventure games.
coth0204	Bret: "How dare you take away my mouse cursor!"
coth0205	Kevin: But the new special edition has point-and-click--
coth0206	Bret: I just found that out today.
coth0207	Kevin: You can play it as was imagined, the boundary-pushing experiment, or you can--
coth0208	Bret: They have erased all our innovation!
coth0209	Kevin: Or you can play it the right way.
coth0210	Bret: Thank God our innovation has been undone.
coth0211	Kevin: Yes. We don't need that crap anymore.
coth0301	Tim: There is no-- This is a really boring fact, I'm going to share it anyway. There is no inventory combinations in "Grim Fandango." You can't use an object with another object in your inventory.
coth0302	Peter M: Oh, that's right.
coth0303	Tim: So if you wanna put the bone in the bone grinder, you have to put them in this receptacle in the room. Another weird mechanical contrivance from my own head: a handheld snow grinder that would plug into a giant snow grinder. I'm sure they have those, right?
coth0304	Peter M: What's a snow grinder?
coth0305	Tim: It's like a fake, like, to make fake snow for the show. And this is what I was talking about, you can't use the hand with the snow grinder.
coth0306	Tim: So you put the snow grinder down, then put the hand in it, and then pick it up. And that's how you combine, that's the one object combination puzzle we have.
coth0307	Tim: I don't know why the lid on it closes. That was like really important, technically.
coly0101	Lleslle: Clint, I wanna bounce off like what you're saying before about the passion that everybody had, because it is. I remember us all just-- It was no big deal to stay the night sometimes, especially towards the end 'cause we were all just trying to fix whatever bugs there were, and just make it better and polished. And I remember some of the conversations that you and I would have about just organization and making sure that, you know, the creative process was supported and all of that. And it just was nice that we all cared about our areas so much, you know?
coly0102	Clint: Absolutely, Lleslle. I think that's really what I was trying to say earlier, is that the goals that everyone set were so high and then they became internalized as the bare minimum. So even though they were beyond necessarily the call of duty, if you will, they were still viewed as must-achieves.
coly0103	Lleslle: Oh yeah, and I think that's like a given on a Tim game thought, right, because his creative, like, bar is so extremely high. And you see him working so much that you just can't-- You can't help it. And especially when you see the game and the story that you're working on, and you want to make sure it's the best. And you can-- Every little nuance, I mean just the music, and like you said, the attention to detail. Just those birds flapping... You know, it's just amazing.
coly0201	Tim: This game was so long and complex, and it had new characters in like the last act and stuff--
coly0202	Peter M: Right.
coly0203	Tim: I was like, "How do we make so much complexity in three years?" I know it sounds like a long time to people who don't-- A lot of it was that it was double-- It was six years because we also worked all night for three years.
coly0204	Peter M: Right, that's true.
coly0205	Tim: We worked all day and all night for three years--
coly0206	Peter M: That is true.
coly0207	Tim: It's like a six year project. And for the good of the games industry we try not to do that anymore. People thought, when the game was going late, like it took longer than-- It was supposed to take like a year, not like three years.
coly0208	Peter M: Yes.
coly0209	Tim: And people wanted to do it episodically. They're like, "Let's just release it episodically." But... who knows what would happen if we had done that. It might not have made act two... or act three.
coly0210	Peter M: Mm hm.
coly0211	Tim: ... 'cause the way things were changing at the company.
coly0301	Tim: I think he's doing Army. I think that's his deal. He's doing, like, soldier boy--
coly0302	Peter M: Right, yeah, no, I get it. It's like Gomer Pyle, yeah.
coly0303	Tim: Kind of. Kind of like Gomer-- Not Gomer! No, he's doing, um--
coly0304	Peter M: Well, I mean, not Gomer specifically himself. But that sort of world of humor.
coly0305	Tim: Mm hm, mm hm.
coly0306	Peter M: Like um... T. Boone Pickens. No, not T. Boone Pickens, but T.--
coly0307	Tim: T. Bone?
coly0308	Peter M: T. Bone Pickens.
coly0309	Tim: That's like, that's someone who will just--
coly0310	Peter M: Slim Pickens! There we go.
coly0311	Tim: Exactly!
coly0312	Peter M: Like Slim Pickens in, um, "Dr. Strangelove."
coly0401	Tim: I relied on Tony Plana to improvise a lot of Spanish, 'cause I didn't write any of the Spanish in the dialogue. I'd write "buddy." It was always like, "Buddy! Hey, buddy! What's going on, buddy?"
coly0402	Peter M: And you would say, "Eh jefe," or something like that.
coly0403	Tim: Yeah. He would say, um, "carnal," which is like... "Carnal" is like really close, like--
coly0404	Peter M: Like carnal, like a blood brother.
coly0405	Tim: Yeah, blood brother. And then it's like, um... I think he calls him "hermano," like "brother" in a few places. And also the "hijole!" And then there's a really bad word for "goat," which he's like, "Oh, in Cuba"--he's a Cuban actor--and he's like, "That's not that bad in Cuban. In Mexico that's a swear word." But I mean here-- So there's some, there's some Spanish in here that might be, um, not for children.
coly0406	Peter M: Need a rating?
coly0407	Tim: Yeah, need a rating--only in Spanish.
cozw0101	Julian: You know, but hearing all these names, too, I just feel like a lot of times I'll catch myself saying, "I went there," instead of, "I worked there," because it was really like being-- It was an extension of college and it was just everyone. We were all friendly, we all hung out together, so whether we were hanging out at work or at someone's house, I mean it was just all a blur, you know?
cozw0102	Lleslle: That's funny, I went... "I went to LucasArts."
cozw0103	Julian: Yeah. Lucas High.
cozw0201	Tim: I think something that helped make this game--one of the secrets to it--was just watching a lot of old movies. Like a lot of this-- It's like some of them are references, but a lot of them are like, um, plot elements, ideas of relationships between people is the subtle stuff that came out of watching old black and white movies, 'cause they just did stuff so differently then, and every... I mean, I know there were formula movies back then but they're not the current formulas, you know, and they're not as pat as the movies you'd watch today. They're surprising, like old film noir movies had relationships between people that feel really different than modern relationships. Some of them are messed up and based on old social things, and some of them are just like, cooler? It's weird.
cozw0202	Peter M: Well, there's a certain stoicism that you don't... You don't...
cozw0203	Tim: And a certain--
cozw0204	Peter M: A kind of reserve, maybe, you don't see in characters now.
cozw0205	Tim: And a little bit of an honesty in characters, like nowadays you don't... I think the way that people talk now, there's like, there's different layers of meaning to everything, and different subtexts--
cozw0206	Peter M: Say "everything's cool," which means, you know... Which means, "eff you," you know, which means that... No, it's more like things were...
cozw0207	Tim: Even though they're old, they're very refreshing, is what I'm saying. Like "Casablanca" has a lot of just honest-- People talking honestly to each other in a way that's different than a modern movie.
cofi0101	Kevin: So yeah, one of the things that I think people don't realize is it's not just pre-rendered art, but there's pre-rendered z-buffers--
cofi0102	Bret: That's right.
cofi0103	Kevin: -- through the whole thing. And we thought that the pre-rendered z-buffers would just do all the work for us, and it turned out that--if you look through the game data--the pre-rendered z-buffers, there's a lot of hand=painted pre-rendered z-buffers. We made a z-buffer editing tool which was funky because you-- It's 16-bit data, and you can't edit 16-bit data in a 8-bit monitor, so...
cofi0104	Bret: It was grayscale. It looks like a ghost scene. It's like you look into like a foggy version of the world.
cofi0105	Kevin: Yeah, so we did like a quantized 8-bit version of it and you could paint into it. People would just use like big boxes and find places where he was clipping, or we didn't want him to clip. A lot of it was we wanted-- He was slightly behind something and he shouldn't have been, so he would like go into the edge of the sofa or something and you just black it out.
cofi0106	Bret: Just black it out, yeah.
cofi0107	Kevin: So that he would pop in front of it.
cofi0108	Bret: Yep.
cofi0201	Darragh: There's a character who shows up later on called The Florist, who is played by a great actor called Keith Szarabajka, who I've worked with a lot over the years and... Keith... Oftentimes, when he auditions the characters-- The way he does his auditions, it's not, they're not usually safe choices that he makes. And the first time I came across him was-- He was auditioning for Boston Low ["The Dig"] and he just... You know, Boston Low is a space commander, and Keith was doing something very... deep and dark and strange, and because his last name is Szarabajka, it just sort of stuck in my head and I used to always look forward to whatever audition Keith was gonna throw our way, and they were always bizarre and never appropriate. And then when he auditioned for The Florist, who's insane because he-- In the real world he's a florist and he deals with flowers, which are beautiful things, but in the "Grim Fandango" world it's death. He's gone crazy. And um... he's deranged. And Keith just nailed the part and was just brilliant and it was at the moment that I realized, oh, he's actually a normal dude and he can do all sorts of other things but just his audition choices are, you know are different and unusual.
cofi0301	Peter M: Yeah we used the sarangi, um, it's the Indian cello--
cofi0302	Tim: Oh, awesome.
cofi0303	Peter M: -- to sort of make a reference to the hippies, I guess you'd say.
cofi0304	Tim: Who was the... the guy with The Beatles?
cofi0305	Peter M: Uh, George Harrison--
cofi0306	Tim: No, the-- The guru they hung out with.
cofi0307	Peter M: Oh, the guru. The Maharishi, yeah. And also, um... Ravi Shankar was sort of a... friend of theirs. He was like a friend of theirs.
cofp0101	Tim: I really didn't like early 3-D, like nineties 3-D 'cause I always though it looked like cardboard boxes that were taped together and that someone had dragged nylons over, you know? And that implies a lot more smooth skinning than actually existed. It was really like-- And then everything was painted on the outside, even things that should be modeled as an interior space, like ribs on a skeleton or something. Everything was painted on the outside, and it looked ridiculous.
cofp0102	Peter M: So it looked like everybody was wearing a Halloween costume anyway.
cofp0103	Tim: Yeah! And then I saw those papier-mβchι skeletons where they painted the ribs on the outside and I was like, "This is perfect. This kind of folk art would actually look really good in 3-D." There was a lot of pressure to get into 3-D back then 'cause it was seen as the future. I mean obviously it was 'cause a lot of, um, everything turned into 3-D, but 2-D is still a big money-making thing in games, too.
comy0101	Clint: You know, Lleslle, I remember how you worked to keep everyone together and to help the team snuff out bugs and get this thing finished up, and I have to confess something after all these years that as we would observe bugs in the game, that translated merely to us as, "Okay, fellas, we have more time. Let's get back to work. Let's make this stuff even better." And so we'd see someone's head float off their body and just exit the screen while their body continued to remain on screen, and we'd say, "That's at least another month."
comy0102	Lleslle: So that's how you got more time.
comy0103	Clint: We knew what the schedule was by just simply playing the game.
comy0201	Peter M: You can hear your brother's charango in this, yeah.
comy0202	Tim: Really?
comy0203	Peter M: Yeah, it's-- Well, it was a second ago. I think I heard it.
comy0204	Tim: Hm.
comy0205	Peter M: It's somewhere in the Mayan train station music.
comk0201	Paul: There was somebody that will remain nameless, but uh, I remember that they said--'cause they'd come out of advertising--and they said, "Well, there's three types of animation. There are dogs and cats who chase each other, there are dogs and cats that talk to each other, and then there are logos that spin around. Those are the three types of animation."
comk0202	Dave: That made one potentially amazing animator quit--
comk0203	Paul: Yes, and come to Pixar.
comk0204	Dave: That ended up being a suit at Pixar. So you can do your own homework to find out who that was.
conq0101	Dave: I imagined these pigeons being all over the game, everywhere! And they just showed up in a couple places, and it made me sad.
conq0102	Alex: I think I wrote up a crappy bug about that, and I said, "We want more pigeons!"
conq0103	Dave: Thank you, man!
conq0104	Alex: "Closed."
conq0105	Peter T: I think we ran into the polygon limit and we could only have so many. The pigeons--
conq0106	Dave: Were alpha flats. There were many, many alpha flats.
conq0107	Peter T: Yeah, but there were a lot of them, and they were actually some of the highest poly things in the game, so...
conq0108	Dave: It's my fault.
conq0109	Peter T: 'cause I think every bone got built on the pigeons.
conq0110	Dave: They were actually really fun to animate.
conq0111	Peter T: Yeah, the pigeons were a real fiasco. Sorry, Alex.
conq0112	Dave: It's kind of hard-- It was my first experience--
conq0113	Alex: I appreciate-- This finally brings come closure to the pigeon situation.
conq0114	Peter T: I'm answering your bug right now.
conq0115	Mark: Let's close this bug out.
conq0116	Dave: That was also my first experience animating something and not knowing how it was going to be used, so that was kind of like a different mental shift for me... Um... And it was just the first time I had had to make a bunch of idles, and loops or, you know, take-offs and lands that all had to work together. It was pretty interesting. I remember swearing.
conq0201	Darragh: I remember one day Tony [Plana] came into the studio and he had a silk shirt on and on top of the silk shirt he had a sort of a little sweater... a sleeveless sweater. And we were recording, it was like, "Gah, what are we hearing? What are we hearing?" And the engineer's like, "Oh, I think it's his sweater." We're like, "Hey, Tony, can you take your sweater off?" Takes his sweater off, back to rolling again. Sound's still there. So the-- He took his sweater off, and went back to rolling. It turned out it was his shirt that was making the noise, and we're like, "Tony, it's the shirt! It's the silk shirt." And so he's like, "It's okay, I got a T-shirt on underneath." So he was down--
conq0202	Julian: Just stripping down!
conq0203	Darragh: -- down, yeah, he was stripping down into his T-shirt, and did the rest of the session in his T-shirt. But that was the thing with Tony, is he just loved-- You know, he loved working. For part of the production he was shooting at night on a movie, and there were a couple of days where he came in and he only had like a couple of hours, you know a few hours of sleep. And I remember saying, like, "I can reschedule the session." And he's like, "No no no, let's do it, let's do it." And he always was there to give it-- Yeah, giving it his all.
conq0301	Tim: One of the standard things that happens in noir is that a guy meets a woman that just spirals him into a world of shadows and intrigue and stuff like that. And sometimes it's because it's a femme fatale who's up to no good, and sometimes it's also a totally innocent woman who just happens to be on this path that she's-- She's in sort of trouble and he gets pulled into it. So you meet Meche in this world and it spins Manny off into this whole different path, but it's really-- For some reason it was important to me that Manny was actually partially to blame, or feel like he was partially to blame. Like he thought he had caused her to be lost, when it was actually Domino's fault that she was sent off. He stole her Number Nine Ticket.
conq0302	Peter M: Well, you didn't want to blame the woman, like say "Double Indemnity" does, or--
conq0303	Tim: Yeah, where she was actually scheming and where-- Yeah, this is more someone who Manny feels like he has caused misfortune to come to.
conq0304	Peter M: Or "Maltese Falcon" does for that matter, yeah.
conq0401	Tim: I haven't done it in too many games, but having a year transition between things and changing the location and letting you pick up friends and travel, like, just allows you to have so much character development where Manny and Glottis have now been through a lot of stuff together and they've done... They're in different clothes, which is-- They're in different jobs and they move from town to town together and just, it starts to build this real friendship between them, which is... nice, and I think I realize I'm going to put four year transitions in all games from now on, just so we can have that kind of relationship building.
conq0501	Lleslle: Yeah, I remember having to get extensions. That was like my favorite--
conq0502	Julian: Oh yeah.
conq0503	Lleslle: No, I would have to go in 'cause I'd be the same thing, because I always advocate for the artist, and I did. I mean, that's why I loved working with Tim. He's so creative. And so we would talk and collaborate, and then when I'm like, "No, look, this is the date," 'cause I'm trying to save the date, and he did the ship story. And so then we had to go get more time, and I was like, "Well, how are we going to do that?" And then he was like, "Here's my technique. I go into Jack's office and I stay in there and I threaten to light myself on fire, and I just scream and I stay in there until he extends the date." And I'm like, "That's a great... strategy."
conq0504	Julian: It worked.
conq0505	Lleslle: I know! Threaten to light myself on fire--
conq0506	Clint: Well, see we would never try that in the sound department because Jack would just say, "Go ahead."
conq0507	Julian: Yeah, yeah!
come0101	Paul: Well I think it's neat, too, that we've just... with Tim's storytelling, we come to see flowers as a bad thing, and to see an actual meadow full of flowers. It makes something that would be pretty, uh, ominous.
come0102	Alex: It's grotesque, yes.
come0103	Mark: It's a mass grave.
come0104	Dave: That's crazy. That's a lot of flowers. That's a lot of polygons right there.
come0105	Paul: So, yeah, those are individual flowers in the foreground and then, in the background that they were-- Pardon me, textures.
come0106	Dave: And Paul didn't copy and paste any of them. He built each one.
come0107	Paul: I grew them digitally. I put water on my--
come0108	Dave: He built them really small, and then I had to animate and scale each one of them up to the proper size.
come0201	Tim: I programmed a whole thing here that accurately figured out which window you're aiming at in the greenhouse, like based on your angle of rotation and stuff. It's totally not even for a puzzle, you don't even... I don't know how I figured out which level of... I guess how close you are to the greenhouse.
come0202	Tim: We remember the stuff we worked on the most, and figuring out which window to smash when you're shooting was my little touch here... all for nothing... 'cause you don't even shoot him in there.
come0301	Tim: Oh, I think I thought of the scary thing that ends in a greenhouse. It's, um, "Frosty the Snowman."
come0302	Peter M: Fro... [trails off into laughter]
come0303	Tim: Remember "Frosty the Snowman," they travel with a snowman and then she needs to stay warm so he brings her--she's going to freeze to death--so he brings her into a greenhouse, but then the bad magician locks them inside the greenhouse, and so he melts--
come0304	Peter M: Oh, so it's like a version of "Frozen."
come0305	Tim: -- and I almost cry every time.
come0306	Peter M: Ohh.
come0307	Tim: And then Santa comes and reminds you that it's magic snow, Christmas snow that he's made out of.
come0308	Peter M: Oh my goodness, I missed out on that.
come0309	Tim: So this is obviously a reference to "Frosty the Snowman."
come0310	Peter M: Yeah, that's a famous noir for sure.
come0311	Tim: Mm hm, one of the-- I mean, modern noir.
come0312	Peter M: Yeah.
come0313	Tim: Its themes are subtle.
come0401	Tim: I love how the audio here tells the story of the deadly chemicals moving up the pipes, and...
come0402	Peter M: So he kind of kills him from a distance. It's like the end of, uh... "Big Sleep."
come0403	Tim: I forgot that.
come0404	Peter M: Yeah. Shoots him from behind a car.
cohf0101	Tim: I do remember--during "Full Throttle"--you saying, "You know what we never made here is just a real, like, swing era, crime, film noir story." And it always kind of stuck with me 'cause I was like, "Yeah, we never have done one of those. We should do one because..." I don't know what started us-- A lot of us at the company were starting to get into film noir. I don't know if it was because there was a film festival at the Lark Theater, where they showed every single great noir film, and we went to that. Or if it was... just we were at that age where you start reading Raymond Chandler. We talked about Raymond Chandler a lot in the office, too. You were like, "She was so cold, a lump of spumoni wouldn't melt on her shoulder--"
cohf0102	Peter M: "Slice of spumoni wouldn't have melted on her shoulder," yeah.
cohf0103	Tim: Always stuck with me. I was like, "Man I gotta read more Raymond Chandler." So that started me on that.
cohf0104	Peter M: He's awesome. Yeah and during, it was either "Day of the Tentacle" or "Full Throttle," I wrote a little gangster theme just 'cause I thought it would be cool. It just popped into my head and I wanted to put the melody down, and that might have prompted that comment about it'd be cool if we did a noir thing someday.
cohf0201	Tim: I'm glad I put that in there. I didn't even know that happened. Manny actually got to do some salesmanship. Manny actually got to be a travel agent in the game. I've totally forgotten that.
cohf0202	Tim: Genius! Whoever made this is a genius.
cohf0203	Tim: That's what this commentary is all about. Just me watching things and being like, "Ah, dang. Good job."
cohf0204	Peter M: Yeah. Nice going, nice going.
conl0101	Bret: All we had to do was extract the text lines and just do what they'd always done for all the SCUMM games. But um, I had a brother who was a screenwriter in Hollywood, and he had all these special tools to format his scripts, you know as a screenplay. And I was like, "You know, it'd be really cool if I gave Darragh something he could bring into those guys who were really familiar with screenplays. He could bring them something that looked like a screenplay." So when I wrote the dialogue extraction I made it, um actually format it like a script, and actually did the character swing back and forth. And I gave Tim a way that he could indicate, in comments in the code-- If you format the comments a certain way, like you know, "she pouts," or, "huffily," or some other kind of cue, I would extract that and put it along with it. So just like in a normal screenplay you'd have like, you know, here's my line, "haughty" or whatever, you'd have some cue to the actor about how it's supposed to be read. And I even put in scene markers, like this is in the High Roller Casino, or this is exterior docks, so they had a context for where it was in the game. And uh, through the magic of HTML--the web was new--I was able to just spit out HTML, so that's what I did. I wrote a-- I made a screenplay-looking thing in HTML and then they were able to print out and take it down there.
cote0101	Kevin: I remember the, um, the big wall of concept art. There was like--
cote0102	Bret: Yeah, Chan art.
cote0103	Kevin: And fifteen feet tall. And you'll see on the Internet--probably see some of it on the special edition--of these pencil drawings that are-- And you really, you only get to see them one at a time, but they were hundreds of them, and they were all pinned up to this giant cork board.
cote0104	Bret: Yeah, it's like wallpaper.
cote0105	Kevin: They were like wallpaper, yeah. And it was amazing to see this beautiful art transform from these pencil drawings on the wall into the game in front of you.
cote0106	Bret: They kept the style in a lot of cases, I mean some of the things in the 3-D scenes were amazing.
cote0107	Kevin: Yeah, the faithfulness to those original Peter Chan drawings is incredible.
colw0101	Paul: Oh my God.
colw0102	Mark: Look at that.
colw0103	Paul: I forgot about this set.
colw0104	Mark: That looks like a painting or something, it's great.
colw0105	Paul: Yeah it, uh, this was one of the-- Yeah when you get a Peter Chan drawing, this one was a widow maker as well where you just thought, "How does that pipe go in that?"
colw0106	Gaurav: Things didn't quite line up.
colw0107	Dave: You know, I was gonna say that environment with the pipes in it, it almost had like a... a "Day of the Tentacle" or "Sam and Max" feel to it. You know, there's a lot distortion in the pipes and felt a little more wacky than what we see in the rest of the environments.
colw0108	Paul: No, definitely.
cosh0101	Darragh: I didn't put in too many late nights, but there was one where I was in the office at two in the morning, just making notes on the script, and all of a sudden Chuck Jordan walks by my office and says, "Hi!" And there was a way about him that-- Ten minutes later I got up from my desk. I went over to his office and went in and said, "Did you just get in?" And he's like, "Yeah. I get in at two." "Two in the morning?" He's like, "Yeah." And I guess that he'd put in so many late nights that his whole time clock had shifted and so he'd said to Tim, he said, "Hey is it okay if I just come in at two in the morning?" And Tim was like, "Sure!"
cosh0201	Tim: I really like puzzles where you use things backwards. Like you use the-- Instead of finding and using a metal detector to find something metal, you use something metal to find a metal detector in the kitty litter puzzle. And then here you're... Instead of, um... Sprouting, shooting sproutella into bones, you're using bone flakes to um... Expose a sproutella chain. I love this room! It looks almost exactly like the concept art. It looks so painted.
cosh0202	Peter M: Or to open a door you lock it.
cosh0203	Tim: Mm hm. Maybe that's just the formula for all the puzzles. You do something backwards.
cotg0101	Tim: One of the core things about adventure games we'd think about a lot was, what is keeping the player going forward? What is the reward? Because, you know, in RPG games you kill somebody, you get loot, you get items and stuff like that. Or you get rank, you know? So what is the reward for, um... playing adventure games? And it's environments, really.
cotg0102	Peter M: Yes, discovering a new place.
cotg0103	Tim: It's unlocking the new environment. I mean sometimes a cutscene and stuff, but really it's... environments and finding new places.
cotg0201	Peter M: The guy who played the, um, played these Peruvian flutes I believe is from Peru. Have to look at the credits again. He lives in the Mission. It's like the whole "Grim" score lives in the Mission.
cotg0301	Tim: And it's also spiritual in the way that it feels-- That's how you feel like, you feel like this is the end of the game. Because when you get to the part in the story where people are in the clouds, or in the heavens, and you start to hear the pan flute music you know you're kind of near the end of the story, somehow. But then you go back! And there's a whole other year, which creates a feeling of the game being super long. Like I'm playing "Mario" right now and there's a, like more and more levels-- After the end of the story there's more and more, which makes it feel really long, but if you just-- Like it ends at level five, and there's two more levels, but if you like had seven levels people wouldn't appreciate it. But if you end it at five, and then you have, "Oh oh, there's more levels!" It feels really long.
cotg0302	Peter M: It's like the, it's the encore effect.
cotg0303	Tim: Mm hm.
cobs0101	Dave: Alex, you had mentioned on our break that you were the master of playing through this game the most quickly.
cobs0102	Alex: That's right.
cobs0103	Dave: I think you should talk about that 'cause this-- When I played this game, I think it took me a couple of days.
cobs0104	Alex: Yeah. I think, I mean, I'm interested in playing the Remastered version to see how long it takes me. I think it'll be, you know, twelve hours or more. But when we were in test, obviously we were playing it every single day. We knew it inside and out. But when a brand new build came down we always had to play through from beginning to end, and I was the person that always ended up doing that 'cause I could do it the fastest. And I got down to just a little over an hour playthrough time. I wanna say like an hour and ten minutes was my fastest time. Yeah, it was um, it was something else, and I knew this--the whole game--like instinctually, and now I barely remember any of it.
cobs0105	Dave: You must have been able to skip through cutscenes or something--
cobs0106	Alex: Oh yeah, you can. And you can skip dialogue, too.
cobs0107	Dave: I think the cutscene tape that we received so we could watch them, I wanna say was almost two hours long.
cobs0108	Mark: It was like an hour and forty-five minutes, or something.
cobs0109	Paul: Good Lord.
cobs0110	Alex: I'd like to watch that. I mean, I guess we're watching it right now.
comt0101	Tim: I remember what you said once about playing I think it was the Day of the Dead theme... And you got the band to play that. And then you asked them like, "Hey, guys, would you, uh, is this something you might play? Like in your own band?" And they said, "Maybe on Halloween."
comt0102	Peter M: Yeah, that's right.
comt0103	Tim: Which I never-- It doesn't sound like a Halloween piece of music to me, but I guess they were just saying it was freaky.
comt0104	Peter M: Yeah.
comt0105	Tim: Or unusual.
comt0201	Tim: Now that's the ash tray that is-- The very first shot of the game and the very last shot of the game are the same, just like in "Sugarland Express." The shot of the little figurines around that ash tray is the same as the band that stands around this fountain later. That's how you prove that you took at least one film school class in college. You make the first shot the same as the last shot. Basic stuff.
cotd0101	Julian: It's funny 'cause Pete [McConnell] was always great at knowing-- Not only would he know it was gonna slip, he would always say, "Nah, nah..." And then he'd spew out a date. And he was always within weeks, you know. He always-- And sometimes that date was way past where we were being told the date was. In fact, it always was. But he was always right. And I don't know if it was just a sixth sense or if it was, um...
cotd0102	Clint: Well, I--
cotd0103	Julian: -- him putting it together.
cotd0104	Clint: I remember specifically what you're talking about. I'm not gonna be completely correct, but early, early in the year I predicted that it would be June, which was about two months past our deadline. And I felt very bold doing that.
cotd0105	Julian: Yeah, totally!
cotd0106	Clint: But I felt pretty-- On solid ground doing that. Of course this was internal, just within the sound group. We never would--
cotd0107	Julian: We never would say that to you.
cotd0108	Clint: -- share this with other people. And Pete immediately fired back: "Day of the Dead." We all said, "What?" "Day of the Dead." What is that, November fourth?
cotd0109	Lleslle: Um yeah, like fourth or fifth. November fifth.
cotd0110	Clint: And so, you know what, he was within-- We'd have to look at Wikipedia. Do you remember the release date? I don't--
cotd0111	Lleslle: Oh, it was October twenty... Oh man it's--
cotd0112	Julian: Close enough.
cotd0113	Lleslle: It was October.
cotd0114	Clint: Within a couple of weeks. He was within a couple of weeks and that was about March, that he did that.
cotd0115	Lleslle: Oh wow.
cotd0116	Clint: And it's quite amazing that he was able to see that distance. I don't know how he did it, but he said it with conviction, too, that's the funniest thing of all. And he ended up being right.
cotd0201	Tim: I love those cars. You don't even get to see them in the game much, but there's some neat concept art of them. They have pipes coming out the side of them, which is weird. It's like Glottis fixed them up. I think they're based on some actual snow cat combined with a--
cotd0202	Peter M: Oh yeah.
cotd0203	Tim: -- panel truck.
cotd0204	Tim: That's-- 'cause like we have, we'd have this list of things that are gonna be in the game, and nothing was just like, "A truck, make a truck." It was like, "No, let's get Peter Chan to design what a cool snow cat truck would look like in the thirties, but also kind of Mayan in a weird way."
cotd0205	Peter M: Yeah, it is kind of Mayan. That's funny.
cotd0206	Tim: Like everything will get designed.
coat0101	Peter M: There was a certain amount of improvisation that-- The more towards the end of the game you got, the more the musicians improvise. And so--
coat0102	Tim: Yeah, this sounds like the meadow, kind of, isn't it?
coat0103	Peter M: It is. It's a little bit like-- In fact, I think it's a remix of some of the tracks I used in the meadow. And they're sort of riffing on the Hector theme.
coat0104	Tim: Wait, how are they... Where is the Hector theme in this?
coat0105	Peter M: Um, the [sings music] is part of, um...
coat0106	Tim: [sings music] Oh my God! You are ripping this whole game wide open with this Hector conspiracy.
coat0107	Peter M: Kind of, yeah... What I do is hum the Hector theme to them before they would start jamming.
#creditscommentary	
cocr0101	Tim: Are we going to have commentary over the credits? This is where you, uh-- They do it on movies. This is where we see names and we're like, "Oh yeah, that guy was cool!"
cocr0102	Peter M: Yeah yeah yeah.
cocr0103	Tim: "Oh I forgot about her. She's cool." And then, "That Tim Schafer's a dirk--jerk." One of those guys is a jerk. I'm not gonna say who. Adam Schnitzer, I forgot to mention Adam Schnitzer. He did that room where you fill the coffins up with the materials. He was awesome. Sara Simon did textures along with Japeth. Jillian Moffett... C. Andrew Nelson, that's right. C. Andrew Nelson was one of the official Darth Vader appearance persons.
cocr0104	Peter M: Jeff did the mixing.
cocr0105	Tim: He was so tall that he could actually wear the costume.
cocr0106	Peter M: Hans Christian was the, uh, cello player.
cocr0107	Tim: There's a guy named Hans Christian?
cocr0108	Peter M: Hans Christian Reumschuessel, actually is his full name, but he just goes by Hans Christian.
cocr0109	Tim: Charango provided by Martin Schafer.
cocr0110	Peter M: Yeah.
cocr0201	Tim: Senior voice editor, Khris Brown, still hanging around! Causing trouble. Um... watching these credits, you get that weird feeling-- Like usually, you don't do stuff in sequence. You don't work from the beginning of the game to the end. You work on all parts, all around, usually. But this is the one thing where, like, these ending credits were the things we were doing... Like wiring this up happened the night before we shipped, or something, like we were really... And so we didn't-- We were like, "Can you approve the credits?" And we're just watching and we're like super tired, we gotta ship this game. Like, "Yeah, they look good. Yeah."
cocr0202	Tim: Race cat names by the "Grim Fandango" team. Oh, there were some race cat names that happened with the-- I sent out a message like, "Hey, can you guys help me think of--"
cocr0203	Peter M: Oh, that's right! The "Secrets of the Luftwaffe" theme. I'd forgotten Mike's theme was in there.
cocr0204	Tim: Wait, where is the--
cocr0205	Peter M: I think it's in the-- I think it might be in the blimp music?
cocr0206	Tim: That's an interesting--
cocr0207	Peter M: Yeah, I forgot all about that.
cocr0208	Tim: Me, I don't remember that even happening. You know I didn't play a lot of SWOTL. I played "Battle Britain," but not a lot of SWOTL.
cocr0301	Tim: ... and the box. But um, but yeah, so when you watch it I totally remember that weird last night feeling of... production. Which is always really weird, especially with the disc-based stuff. Before, the idea-- Now we think, "Ah, we'll fix it, we'll patch it," you know. I mean, we totally care about the quality of the game of course, but if something really, really bad happened, we'd patch it. But in a disc-based game, we weren't as into patching. It could happen but it-- So you really were like, "Oh God, this is-- I'm so nervous to ship this thing." Like saying it's done, saying you're not gonna fix any more bugs. It's done done was so much more final. So these last few days when you've just done everything you can for the game and you're just trying to wire the credits together in the last few minutes... So I'm feeling that stressful feeling right now.
cocr0302	Peter M: You know, it's the first ninety percent of a game is no big deal. It's the second ninety percent that's the tough...
cocr0303	Tim: Nice.
cocr0304	Peter M: That's the tough part. That's kind of--
cocr0305	Tim: Denise Gollaher! Still works at Double Fine. There you go.
cocr0401	Peter M: Steve Dauterman.
cocr0402	Tim: I'm not gonna mention any of those names. What? No, Steve Dauterman, he worked--
cocr0403	Peter M: He works in, uh--
cocr0404	Tim: He went to Australia but now he's somewhere else.
cocr0405	Peter M: Oh yeah. No, I just talked to him.
cocr0406	Tim: Alan Dundes... Alan Dundes was my anthropology teacher in Berkeley, where I learned about the Day of the Dead, that started this whole crazy thing. Spinray is, uh... you.
cocr0407	Peter M: Yeah, that's my band. What was that, what were you doing in there? Probably just special thanks.
cocr0408	Tim: These are special thanks, and the team got to pick--
cocr0409	Peter M: Yeah, 'cause they're kinda like my family. So when I wasn't at rehearsal, I think like-- Thanks for putting up with me not being there.
cocr0410	Tim: And I'm sure it meant a lot to them when they played this game. That's what I always say about the cats. One of my pet peeves, I hate cat and pet "thank yous" in credits.
cocr0411	Peter M: Oh yeah.
cocr0412	Tim: 'cause I'm like, okay, even if the cat figured out how to use Steam. Even if the cat figured out how to download this game--
cocr0413	Peter M: No that-- Good point.
cocr0414	Tim: How would they-- Would they even finish adventure-- How would they get past the sign post puzzle? Like that, there's no way a cat could get that far. They're not gonna see this-- Your "thank you."
cocr0501	Peter M: It's true. And probably they were just hanging out and enjoying themselves anyway.
cocr0502	Tim: Yeah. They have-- No way they'd have the patience for an adventure game. So with that thought, there we go. That's wrapping up the final... Thanks everybody for playing. Thanks for buying the remaster, or pirating it, however you got it. And thanks, Peter McConnell, for still working on games with me.
cocr0503	Peter M: Yeah, alright.
cocr0504	Tim: It's been a long time.
cocr0505	Peter M: Thank you.
cocr0506	Tim: I've learned a lot about "Grim Fandango" in this session, like how many times you got that one piece of music to work out for you. That was amazing. And it was really fun watching it again. And now I know how to solve all the puzzles for when I do my Let's Play of it, I'll actually act like I know what I'm doing. I don't wanna leave now 'cause I like the way my voice sounds.
cocr0507	Peter M: It's like basking in the glow, isn't it?
cocr0508	Tim: I wish everyone could hear me this clearly and loudly all the time. Alright! Thank you for playing. I'll say that now 'cause we never used to put that in the credits, and we do every time now, so we'll just say it now.
cocr0509	Peter M: Thanks for listening, too.
cocr0510	Tim: No one's gonna listen to this.
cocr0511	Peter M: Ah, that's right.

moma069	Το δρεπάνι μου--μ'αρέσει να το φυλάω δίπλα στο μέρος όπου ήταν η καρδιά μου.
moma127	Η σχέση μας έχει προχωρήσει παραπέρα από αυτό.
moma070	Δε θέλω να χαλάσω τη λεπίδα μου.
motx071	memo
moma072	Είναι κάποια ειδική εντολή εργασίας...
moev073	Προς: Όλους τους πράκτορες. Από: Το γραφείο του Διευθυντή Don Copal.
moco074	Λοιπόν κουφιοκέφαλοι, ευχαριστείστε την τύχη σας και τσακιστείτε στ'αμάξια σας!
moco075	Έχουμε μια μαζική δηλητηρίαση στα χέρια μας!
moco076	Οι νεκροί είναι πολλοί για να τους αναθέσουμε συγκεκριμένα, γι'αυτό όποιον πελάτη προλάβατε, προλάβατε!
moco077	Έτσι λοιπόν, όπως σπείρετε θα θερίσετε, και όπως θερίσετε θα πάρετε προμήθεια!
moco078	Γι'αυτό να σας δω να τρέχετε!
moco079	Πάμε! Πάμε! Πάμε!
moma080	Ότι πεις εσύ αφεντικό.
moma081	Θα μπορούσα να φτιάξω ένα χάρτινο αεροπλανάκι, αλλά είμαι απασχολημένος.
moma082	Τα σημειώματα είναι για διάβασμα και πέταμα, όχι κάτι άλλο.
motx083	tube
moma084	Απ'ότι φαίνεται έχω μήνυμα.
moma085	Ο σωλήνας μηνυμάτων είναι γεμάτος τίποτα, ως συνήθως.
moma086	Δεν υπάρχει πίεση αέρα.
moma087	Το δίκτυο πρέπει να χάλασε.
moma088	Υπάρχει ήδη κάτι εκεί μέσα.
moma089	Χε. Προσέξτε οι από κάτω.
motx090	books
moma091	Το αφεντικό μου δίνει συνέχεια αυτά τα βιβλία για πωλητές...
moma092	"Αγόρασαν Τη Φάρμα, Τώρα Πουλήστε Τους Τις Αγελάδες", τέτοια πράγματα.
moma093	Τα διάβασα. Δε βοήθησαν.
motx094	deck of playing cards
moma095	Αυτή η τράπουλα έχει ξεφτίσει στις άκρες.
moma096	Απ'την άλλη βέβαια, και εγώ το ίδιο και έχω και λιγότερα μπαστούνια.
moma097	Είναι μια τράπουλα.
moma098	Ας την πάρω καλύτερα-- μάλλον θα περάσω όλη τη μέρα ρίχνοντας πασίεντζες.
moma099	Έχω ήδη μια κάρτα, και δε μοιράζω άλλες μέχρι να δω χρήματα στο τραπέζι.
moma100	Μια τράπουλα δε βοηθάει εκεί.
motx101	card
moma128	Ω, θα είναι τράπουλα για πίνακλ!
moma102	Δεν ξέρω να παραβιάζω κλειδαριές μ'αυτό τον τρόπο.
moma103	Αυτή η κάρτα είναι γεμάτη τρύπες.
moma104	Πάντα ήθελα να σημαδέψω αυτή την τράπουλα...
moma105	Δε έχω όρεξη να ρίξω τα χαρτιά τώρα.
moma106	Αυτή η κάρτα δεν παίζει εκεί.
motx107	computer
moma108	Ο υπολογιστής μου δίνει άμεση πρόσβαση στην βάση δεδομένων των νεκρών.
moma109	(Δεν μπορώ να καταλάβω.)
moma110	(Γιατί δε βρίσκω τίποτα καλό για την Meche;)
moma111	Ας κλείσω το φάκελο του Bruno πριν τα μαύρα σημάδια κάψουν την οθόνη.
moma112	Να ο φάκελος του Celso.
moma113	Το μπαστούνι ήταν πολύ καλό γι'αυτόν.
motx114	file cabinet
moma115	Α, τα παλιά αρχεία, οι παλιοί πελάτες, οι μέρες της δόξας...
moma116	Που οι άνθρωποι πέθαιναν με αξιοπρέπεια, και ο Domino Hurley δεν υπήρχε.
moma117	Δεν θέλω να τα ξαναδιαβάσω. Απλά θα λυπηθώ.
motx118	closet
moma119	Στον ακριανό θάλαμο κρεμάω το μανδύα μου.
moma120	Δεν έχει τίποτα μέσα εκτός από το μανδύα μου.
moma121	Εμ, θα τον αφήσω να αεριστεί λίγο ακόμα.
motx122	Meche
moma123	Εμένα μια χαρά μου φαίνεται.
moma124	Δε μ'αρέσει να κάνω τέτοια με τους πελάτες.
motx125	door
momc126	Συγγνώμη που σ'απογοήτευσα, Manny.
momc001	Αυτό είναι μεγάλη ευθύνη, Κύριε Calavera.
momc002	Τι σας κάνει να πιστεύετε ότι ήμουν τόσο καλή;
moma003	Κυρία Colomar--
momc004	Meche σας παρακαλώ.
moma005	Meche. Το βλέπω στο πρόσωπο σου.
moma006	Και στο φάκελο σου, που λέει ότι δικαιούστε ένα πρώτης θέσης εισιτήριο για...
moma007	...πουθενά;
moma008	Τι;!
momc009	Έκανα κάτι στραβά;
moma010	Όχι σύμφωνα με το βιογραφικό σου! Ήταν άψογο!
moma011	...τουλάχιστον το μέρος που διάβασα.
momc012	Δε νομίζω πως μ'αρέσει το υπονοούμενο, Κύριε Calavera.
moma013	Ψάχνω την υπόθεση σου, Meche, αλλά δε βρήκα κάτι για σένα ακόμα.
momc014	Ίσως δεν είμαι αυτή που ήλπιζες.
moma015	Σκεφτόμουν για την υπόθεση σου...
momc016	Μμ-χμμμ;
moma017	Το μόνο υπονοούμενο είναι ότι θα απολυθώ.
momc018	Φταίει κάτι που έκανα;
moma019	Είσαι ΣΙΓΟΥΡΗ ότι είσαι η Mercedes Colomar;
momc020	Ναι, θέλεις να δεις το σημάδι που έχω;
moma021	Κάτι για το παρελθόν σου που δε μου έχεις πει;
momc022	Αρκετά, αν σκεφτείς ότι δε σου είπα τίποτα.
moma023	Τίποτα άλλο που θέλεις να εξομολογηθείς;
momc024	Τι άλλο να πω;
moma025	Με συγχωρείς, αλλά πρέπει να πάω να ξεκαθαρίσω την κατάσταση.
momc026	Συγγνώμη για την φασαρία, Κύριε Calavera.
moma027	Δεν είναι φασαρία, αλλά παρακαλώ...
moma028	Λέγε με Manny.
moma029	Ξέρεις τι πρέπει να κάνω, πρέπει να πάω και να ξεκαθαρίσω την κατάσταση.
moma030	Αμέ. Πού είναι;
momc031	Είναι εκεί που βάλατε το δέρμα μου!
moma032	Ίσως αργότερα.
momc033	Λοιπόν, βιάσου γιατί θα το αποτεφρώσουν σύντομα.
moma034	Τώρα που το ξανασκέφτομαι, καλύτερα να φύγω.
momc035	Βασικά, πιθανότατα έχει αποτεφρωθεί τώρα πια έτσι κι αλλιώς...
moma036	Σκότωνες πολύ όταν ζούσες;
momc037	Πολύ λίγο.
moma038	Δε σκότωσες ποτέ κανέναν;
momc039	Το ομολογώ, δε σκότωσα ποτέ κανέναν.
moma040	Ούτε ένα τόσο δα σκοτωματάκι;
momc041	Μάλλον δεν προσπαθούσα αρκετά.
moma042	Έκλεβες από μαγαζιά;
momc043	Με κατηγόρησαν γι'αυτό μια φορά...
moma044	Αλήθεια;
momc045	Αλλά δεν έφταιγα. Το κουταβάκι με ακολούθησε έξω απ'το κατάστημα.
moma046	Α.
moma047	Κακή με τα ζώα;
momc048	Ω όχι! Αγαπάω τα ζώα.
momc049	Μια φορά, όταν ήμουν εθελόντρια σε καταφύγιο ζώων-- 
moma050	Εδώ μπορείς να σταματήσεις.
moma051	Έκλεψες ποτέ στους φόρους;
momc052	Δεν πλήρωσα ποτέ μου φόρους.
moma053	Α-χα!
momc054	Δεν έβγαλα ποτέ αρκετά λεφτά ώστε να φορολογηθώ.
momc055	Ξέρεις, δούλευα κυρίως εθελοντικά...
moma056	Α-χα.
moma057	Απάτησες ποτέ το σύζυγό σου;
momc058	Κύριε Calavera, δεν υπάρχει δαχτυλίδι στο δάχτυλο μου.
moma059	Ούτε και δέρμα όμως...
momc060	Υποθέτω ότι θα πρέπει να με εμπιστευθείτε τότε.
moma061	Σκουπίδια;
momc062	Ω, Manny. Αυτό είναι το καλύτερο που μπορείς να κάνεις;
moma063	Βοήθα με Meche. Πες μου κάποια ατιμία.
momc064	Θα μπορούσα να κάνω κάτι κακό τώρα αν βοηθάει.
moma065	Δε θα μετρούσε. Συγγνώμη.
moma066	Τα παρατάω.
momc067	Μη το λες αυτό, Manny.
ostx006	car
osma007	Πουλούσα τόσα πολλά ταξιδιωτικά πακέτα αυτοκινήτων όταν ξεκινούσα.
osma008	Πότε έχασα το ταλέντο μου;
osma009	Δε μπορούμε να χειριστούμε αυτοκίνητα, έτσι ξέρουν ότι δε θα το σκάσουμε από τη πόλη.
ostx010	sign
osma011	"ΜΗΝ ΠΑΡΚΑΡΕΤΕ. Μόνο για αυτοκίνητα που μαζεύουν πελάτες".

osma013	Θυμάμαι τη χρονιά που το έχτισαν αυτό...
osma014	Κυρίως επειδή κόστισε τόσο πολύ, που δεν πήραμε μπόνους εκείνη τη χρονιά.

rpma007	Αυτή είναι η ράμπα για τον αυτοκινητόδρομο.

haev165	Manny, τι κάνεις;
hama166	Επιθεώρηση ασφαλείας.
haev167	Ε λοιπόν, βιάσου, με έπιασε ημικρανία.
haev122	Το δίκτυο χάλασε πάλι.
hama123	Τι άλλα νέα;
haev124	Τι είναι αυτό ο απαίσιος τσιριχτός ήχος που κάνεις;
hama125	Καινούργια παπούτσια.
haev126	Manny, σταμάτα να χασομεράς και πήγαινε στο γκαράζ να βρεις οδηγό.
haco127	Εϊ! Κοκαλιάρη!
haco128	Στο γραφείο μου!
haco129	ΤΩΡΑ!
hatx130	Copal
hatx131	hole punch
hama132	Είναι ένας διακορευτής.
hama133	Μπορώ να σου πάρω τον διακορευτή;
haev134	Χα! Αμφιβάλλω αν μπορείς να πάρεις οτιδήποτε από μένα.
haev135	Χεχ.
hama136	Σε πειράζει να χρησιμοποιήσω τον διακορευτή σου;
haev137	Δώσ'του να καταλάβει.
hama138	Ευχαριστώ.
haev139	Σου ηρεμεί τα νεύρα, έτσι;
hama140	Αν κάνω κι άλλες τρύπες θα διαλυθεί!
haev141	Manny, τι κάνεις;
hama142	Απλά μαρκάρω χαρτιά, γλυκιά μου.
hama168	Αυτό πιθανώς να μεταβάλλει την λειτουργικότητα τους.
hatx143	Eva
hama144	Είναι η γραμματέας του αφεντικού μου, η Eva.
haev145	Είναι το σκλαβάκι του αφεντικού μου, ο Manny.
haev146	Ω, Manny. Απλά σκέψου ότι σου λέω μια λέξη τη φορά. Θα καταλάβεις.
haev147	Ίσως κάνω κόλπα με χαρτιά κάποια άλλη φορά, που δε θα'μαι απασχολημένος.
haev148	Ευχαριστώ, αλλά έχω πασιέντζα στον υπολογιστή μου, Manny.
haev169	Α, ΑΥΤΟ κάνει αυτόν τον απαίσιο ήχο.
hatx149	door
hama150	Η πόρτα του Domino είναι κλειδωμένη.
hama151	Μάλλον φοβάται μην του κλέψω κάποιο αρχείο.
hama170	Δεν είναι κακή ιδέα, βασικά.
hatx152	door
haev153	Το Μεγάλο Κύριο Αφεντικό δε θέλει να ενοχληθεί σήμερα.
hama154	Α, η μεγάλη, χρυσή πόρτα της μέτριας διεύθυνσης.
haev155	Λίγο σεβασμό για τον ατρόμητο αρχηγό μας, παρακαλώ.
hama156	Γιατί; Εγώ δουλεύω εδώ περισσότερο καιρό απ'αυτόν, ξέρεις.
haev157	Και είσαι περήφανος γι'αυτό;
hama158	Χμμμ. Σωστό κι αυτό.
hatx159	door
hama160	Δεν πάει πολύς καιρός που στην πόρτα αυτή έγραφε, "Αποθήκη Προμηθειών."

hama162	Αυτό είναι το γρήγορο ασανσέρ για το γκαράζ.
hatx163	elevator
hama164	Αυτό είναι το ασανσέρ για τον προθάλαμο.
hama001	Buenos Dias.
haev002	Manny; Γιατί δεν είσαι στη "δηλητηρίαση";
hama003	Eva, πραγματικά θέλω το αφεντικό να υπογράψει αυτήν την εντολή εργασίας.
haev004	Θα κάνω μια προσπάθεια.
haev005	Κύριε Copal, έχω εδώ τον Manny Calavera που θέλει να σας δει...
haev006	Ε.
haev007	Συγγνώμη, Cal.
haev008	Ίσως αύριο.
hama009	Θα'ναι πολύ αργά!
haev010	Ναι καλά, λες και θα πας πουθενά.
hama011	Έι, έχασες μια καταπληκτική "δηλητηρίαση".
haev012	Ναι, και εσύ έχασες έναν καταπληκτικό πελάτη.
haev013	Ο Domino γύρισε από 'κει με μια καλόγρια.
hama014	Hijole - εγώ έφερα έναν μικροσκοπικό ανθρωπάκο με κακή διάθεση και χωρίς προμήθεια.
haev015	Ναι αλλά τουλάχιστον εσύ δε δουλεύεις γι'αυτόν.
hama017	Ξέρεις, ο Copal δεν είναι στ'αλήθεια στο γραφείο του.
haev018	Γλυκέ μου, ξέρω τι προσπαθείς να κάνεις.
hama019	Ε;
haev020	Προσπαθείς να μ'απομακρύνεις απ'το γραφείο μου, για να συνδέσεις τους συνδετήρες μεταξύ τους πάλι.
haev021	Ωρίμασε πια, καλέ μου.
hama022	’λλη μια μόνο ερώτηση για τη δουλειά μου...
haev023	Μμμ-χμμμ.
hama024	Ποιά "δηλητηρίαση";
haev025	Ναι, την δηλητηρίαση με κωδικό αριθμό 3 με gazpacho όπου όλοι βρίσκονται εκτός από σένα!
haev026	Γιατί στέλνω μηνύματα αν κανείς δεν τα διαβάζει;
hama027	Πού είπαμε ότι είναι η "δηλητηρίαση";
haev028	Απλά ρώτα τον οδηγό σου επιτέλους! Αυτός θα ξέρει.
haev029	Αυτός θα ξέρει.
hama030	Ξέχασα... υποτίθεται ότι θα έπρεπε να είμαι κάπου τώρα;
hama031	Δε μπορώ να βρω τον οδηγό μου.
haev032	Manny, ξέρεις τι πρέπει να κάνεις.
haev033	Σταμάτα να κάνεις το χαζό μόνο και μόνο για να φλερτάρεις μαζί μου.
haev034	Manny, πρέπει να σου εξηγήσω πάλι τη δουλειά σου;
hama035	Κανένα μήνυμα για μένα;
haev036	Εκτός απ'αυτό για την "δηλητηρίαση";
hama037	Ναι.
haev038	Έχω ακόμα μόνο ένα μήνυμα για σένα, Manny...
haev039	Δεν είμαι η γραμματέας σου!
haev040	Δεν παίρνω τα μηνύματα σου!
haev041	Γι'αυτό βάλτο καλά στο κρανίο σου, και σταμάτα να προωθείς τα τηλεφωνήματα σου σε μένα!
hama042	Εντάξει, μα αυτό μου ακούστηκε για ΤΕΣΣΕΡΑ μηνύματα.
hama043	Στην καρδιά μου, πάντως, θα είσαι πάντα η γραμματέας μου.
haev044	Manny, για τι πράγμα μιλάς;
haev045	Δεν ήμουν ΠΟΤΕ η γραμματέας σου, ακόμα και όταν ήσουν στην κορυφή.
haev046	Έχω μόνο ένα αφεντικό, το ίδιο με σένα--τον Don Copal.
hama047	Έλα τώρα. Το ξέρω ότι δουλεύεις και για κάποιον άλλο εκτός από τον Don.
haev048	Τ--
haev049	Τ...Τι εννοείς;
hama050	Ξέρω ότι παίρνεις και μηνύματα για τον Hurley μερικές φορές.
haev051	Ουφ, Manny. Δίνε του, εντάξει;
hama052	Απασχολημένη όπως πάντα, απ'ότι βλέπω.
haev053	Θα είχα πιο πολλή δουλειά να κάνω, αν είχες πιο πολλούς πελάτες.
hama054	’ουτς!
hama055	Πού είναι όλοι;
haev056	Ω, Manny, ξέχασες τι μέρα είναι σήμερα
hama057	Ωχ όχι. Ήρθα πάλι Σάββατο για δουλειά;
haev058	Είναι η Μέρα των Νεκρών!
haev059	Όλοι πήγαν στη Γη των Ζωντανών, να επισκεφτούν τις οικογένειες τους, όπως θα'πρεπε να κάνουμε και εμείς.
hama060	Εσύ γιατί δεν επισκέπτεσαι την οικογένεια σου;
haev061	Ε, αφού είναι εδώ το αφεντικό, πρέπει να είμαι και εγώ εδώ.
haev062	Εσύ, Cal;
hama063	Δεν υπάρχει κανείς που να θέλω να δω.
haev064	...και δε θέλεις μόνο του εδώ τον Domino, να μαζεύει όλα τα στοιχεία.
hama065	Κι αυτό.
hama066	Ο Domino είναι εδώ;
haev067	Είναι στην "δηλητηρίαση" τώρα, και σου κλέβει την προμήθεια.
hama068	Λοιπόν... θα πας στο Χριστουγεννιάτικο πάρτυ;
haev069	Μετά το περσινό όπου έγινες θέαμα;
haev070	Δεν θα το 'χανα για τίποτα στον κόσμο!
hama071	Κανένα καλό κουτσομπολιό;
haev072	Λοιπόν, άκουσα ότι ο Domino πήρε αύξηση.
hama073	Por favor. Πες μου και κανένα καλό νέο, εντάξει;
haev074	Σ'αγαπώ ακόμα.
hama075	Εσένα μόνο χρειάζομαι, Belleza.
hama076	Ναι.
haev077	Λοιπόν, ο Manuel Calavera που ξέρω εγώ μαζεύει ανθρώπους από τη Γη των Ζωντανών...
hama078	Νεκρούς ανθρώπους.
haev079	Κατά προτίμηση.
haev080	Τους φέρνει εδώ και προσπαθεί θαραλλέα να τους πουλήσει το καλύτερο ταξιδιωτικό πακέτο για το όποιο είναι άξιοι.
haev081	Αν πουλήσει αρκετά ποιοτικά πακέτα, ο ήρωας μας θα είναι ελεύθερος να φύγει από τη Χώρα των Νεκρών.
haev082	Μέχρι τότε, αυτός και εγώ έχουμε κολλήσει εδώ...
haev083	...να κάνουμε την ίδια συζήτηση...
haev084	...ξανά και ξανά για μια αιωνιότητα.
hama085	Όχι, αλλά θα'θελα να ακούσω τη δική σου περιγραφή, έτσι για την πλάκα.
hama086	Όχι, απλά θέλω να μάθω που είναι ο οδηγός μου.
haev087	Θέλεις να τον φωνάξω από το μικρόφωνο;
hama088	Ναι.
haev089	Τότε κάνε τον Don να σταματήσει να είναι τόσο τσιγκούνης και να εγκαταστήσει ηχεία.
hama090	Όχι.
haev091	Ωραία, γιατί δεν έχουμε ηχεία.
haev092	Θα πρέπει απλά να περιφέρεσαι στο γκαράζ μέχρι να βρεις κάποιον δαιμόνιο που να έχει άδεια οδηγού.
hama093	Λοιπόν, αρκετά για μένα. Εσένα πώς είναι η δουλειά σου;
haev094	Σαν να προσέχω παιδιά, μόνο που δεν βλέπω και τηλεόραση.
hama095	Γιατί πρέπει να χρησιμοποιήσω δαιμόνιο για οδηγό;
haev096	Μόνο τα δαιμόνια μπορούν να χειριστούν τ'αυτοκίνητα.
haev097	Αν η εταιρία άφηνε εσάς να οδηγήσετε, θα είχατε φύγει όλοι μέσα σε 10 λεπτά.
hama098	Σωστό αυτό.
hama099	Και αν φεύγαμε από την πόλη απόψε;
hama100	Εσύ και εγώ, μωρό μου!
haev101	Ευχαριστώ για την προσφορά, αλλά δεν θα βγαίναμε ποτέ από την πόλη ζωντανοί.
hama102	Μα...
haev103	Ακέραιοι εννοούσα.
hama104	Στοιχηματίζω ότι θα τα κατάφερνα, αν προσπαθούσα πολύ.
haev105	Ω, Manny. Κοίτα τον εαυτό σου.
haev106	Είσαι μια παγιδευμένη ψυχή και δεν το ξέρεις καν.
hama107	Γιατί κάποιοι πελάτες είναι άξιοι για καλύτερα ταξιδιωτικά πακέτα;
haev108	Έζησαν καλές ζωές.
hama109	Que traes! Πώς ορίζεις μια "καλή" ζωή;
haev110	Καλύτερη απ'τη δική σου και τη δική μου.
hama111	Πώς θα πάρω τα στοιχεία ενός καλού πελάτη;
haev112	Γλυκέ μου, εγώ στέλνω τα στοιχεία, αλλά δεν ξέρω ποιός τα παίρνει, και δεν κοιτάω μέσα.
haev113	Εμένα όλα ίδια μου φαίνονται.
haev114	Περίπου σαν κι εσάς.
haev115	Εγώ απλά τα ρίχνω στον σωλήνα, και ο αποστολέας κάτω στα σκαλιά τα ταξινομεί.
hama116	Λοιπόν, τι έκανες στη ζωή σου ώστε να κολλήσεις εδώ;
haev117	Το τι έκανα εκείνες τις μέρες δεν είναι δική σου δουλειά. Ξέρεις τους κανόνες.
hama118	Λοιπόν, να πηγαίνω και εγώ να βαρέσω μύγες.
haev119	Εντάξει, δώσ'τους να καταλάβουν για να μάθουν.
haev120	Manny, αν δε σε πειράζει, έχω πολύ αρχειοθέτηση να κάνω...
hama121	Σωστά. Hay te huacho.
loma017	Α, το παλιό αφεντικό του υπουργείου...
loma018	Πολύ πριν τον καιρό μου.
loma019	Ο Copal συνέχεια λέει για το πόσο σκληρό αφεντικό ήταν πάντως.

gagl029	Όχι, δεν μπορώ. Είμαι... Είμαι...
gagl030	Είμαι πολύ μεγάλος.
gama031	Δεν είσαι πολύ μεγάλος! Είσαι μια χαρά!
gagl032	Όχι, μου το είπαν ξανά και ξανά.
gagl033	Είμαι πολύ μεγάλος για να οδηγήσω.
gama034	Δεν είσαι πολύ μεγάλος. Απλά έχεις πρόβλημα αυτοεκτίμησης.
gagl035	Έχω τι;
gama036	Επανέλαβε μετά από μένα:
gama037	Δεν είμαι χοντρός.
gama038	Είμαι αδύνατος.
gama039	Οι γυναίκες με βρίσκουν γοητευτικό...
gagl040	Έι, δεν είπα ότι ήμουν χοντρός για τις γυναίκες, μόνο για τ'αυτοκίνητα.
gagl041	Στις γυναίκες αρέσω μια χαρά (χε, χε,χε).
gama042	Δεν είσαι πολύ μεγάλος. Τα αυτοκίνητα είναι πολύ μικρά.
gagl043	Ναι! Αυτά τα αναθεματισμένα στενά αυτοκίνητα--
gagl044	Έι! Αυτό μου δίνει μια ιδέα!
gagl045	Θα μπορούσα να τροποποιήσω λίγο τ'αυτοκίνητό σου--με μια γρήγορη οξυγονοκόλληση να βγάλω τους αρμούς, κατάλαβες;
gagl046	Α, αλλά δεν επιτρέπεται να τροποποιήσω τ' αυτοκίνητα χωρίς εντολή εργασίας από τους από πάνω.
gagl047	Μπορεί να χάσω τη δουλειά μου.
gama048	Εντολή εργασίας, ε;
gagl049	Ναι ναι ναι!
gagl050	Δεν μπορώ να κάψω τίποτα μεγαλύτερο από ένα τσιγάρο χωρίς ένα απ' αυτά υπογεγραμμένο από το ίδιο το αφεντικό.
gama051	Έι, αυτή είναι η δουλειά μου--να πείθω ανθρώπους να υπογράψουν.
gama052	Επιστρέφω αμέσως.
gagl053	Ναι, πολύ μικρά! Δεν είμαι εγώ πολύ μεγάλος!
gagl054	Απλά όλα εδώ γύρω είναι πολύ μικρά!
gama055	Βράσε τους κανόνες! Έλα μαζί μου!
gagl056	Όχι, δε θέλω να μπλεχτώ πάλι σε φασαρίες...
gagl057	Είπαν άλλη μια φορά και θα φύγω!
gama058	Τότε, μήπως ξέρεις κάποιον που μπορεί να οδηγήσει;
gagl059	Όλοι έχουν φύγει.
gagl060	Είναι η Μέρα των Νεκρών, ξέρεις.
gama061	Ναι, ναι. Ξέρω.
gama062	Εντάξει, τα λέμε αργότερα, Δειλέ.
gagl063	Ναι. Εντάξει.
gama064	Glottis... Glottis... Είναι Γερμανικό όνομα;
gagl065	Ω, όχι. Η καταγωγή μου δεν είναι από κάποιου Γήινου έθνους την πατρική γη.
gagl066	Είμαι ένα πνεύμα της φύσης που κλήθηκα στη ζωή από την ίδια τη Γη των Νεκρών και μου δόθηκε ένα σκοπός, μια ικανότητα, μια επιθυμία:
gagl067	να ΟΔΗΓΩ.
gagl068	Ή, να αλλάζω λάδια και να ρυθμίζω ιμάντες συγχρονισμού, όταν δεν υπάρχουν δουλειές για οδηγούς.
gama069	Ωραία καλύβα.
gagl070	Ναι, αναρωτιέμαι πόσο ωραία θα σου φαινόταν αν ήσουν ΠΑΓΙΔΕΥΜΕΝΟΣ σ'αυτήν όλη τη μέρα, σαν εμένα.
gama071	Αν μισείς τη δουλειά σου, γιατί δεν παραιτείσαι;
gagl072	Δεν είναι απλά μια δουλειά. Είναι αυτό για το οποίο δημιουργήθηκα να κάνω.
gagl073	Αν απομακρυνθώ περισσότερο από αυτοκίνητα, θα αρρωστήσω και θα πεθάνω.
gagl074	Είναι σαν να μην μπορώ να είμαι ευτυχισμένος εκτός και αν εισπνέω πηχτούς, μαύρους, αηδιαστικούς καπνούς...
gama075	Χμμ. Δεν μπορώ να το φανταστώ.
gama076	Γρήγορα! Φωτιά! Πρέπει να οδηγήσουμε τ'αυτοκίνητα σε ασφαλές μέρος!
gagl077	Όχι. Ούτε καν μια φωτιά δε θα με βγάλει από 'δω μέσα.
gagl078	Έχω κολλήσει εδώ. Για πάντα.
gama079	’ρα είμαστε δύο.
gama080	Σωστά, πίσω στην καλύβα, φίλε.

gssa005	Πώς είναι ο μικρός μου Κόμης του Monte Cristo;
gsma006	Ποιός είναι εκεί έξω;
gssa007	Είμαι εσύ.
gssa008	Ή καλύτερα, ήμουν εσύ, πριν χρόνια.

gsma011	Όχι, αλήθεια. Ποιός ΕΙΣΑΙ;
gssa012	Είμαι και εγώ ένας φυλακισμένος, φίλε μου.
gsma013	Ίσως, αλλά το κελί σου είναι πολύ μεγαλύτερο απ'το δικό μου, "συγκρατούμενε".
gsma014	Σπασμένος. Πάμε για βόλτες.
gsma015	Έι, γιατί δεν ανοίγεις την πόρτα ώστε να το συζητήσουμε το θέμα;
gssa016	Η μόνη διέξοδος, Manuel, είναι να σε ξαναπροσλάβουν.
gssa017	Αν είσαι ακόμη πραγματικά αφοσιωμένος σ'αυτή την εταιρία, διακύρηξε το δυνατά.
gssa018	Η διεύθυνση μπορεί να το ακούσει και να σε ξαναχώσει στο μαντρί της.
gssa019	Αν είσαι ακόμη αφοσιωμένος--
gsma020	Ξάπλωσε, κάνε τούμπες και γάβγισε το μίσος σου για την εταιρία, ξέρω.
gsma021	Πόσες φορές πρέπει πω ότι λυπάμαι;
gssa022	Δε με ενδιαφέρει αν λυπάσαι. Θέλω να μάθω αν είσαι αφοσιωμένος.
gssa023	Είσαι έτοιμος ν'αποκαλύψεις τα πιστεύω σου;
gsma024	Βγάλε με από δω μέσα!
gsma025	Συγγνώμη μικρέ μου σκελετέ. Και τώρα άσε με να βγω!
gsma026	Είμαι απασχολημένος με το σχεδιασμό της ηρωικής μου απόδρασης.
gsma027	Σκέφτομαι να αποδράσω και να εκδικηθώ. Αυτό είναι.
gsma028	Τι θα μου κάνουν;
gssa029	Δε θέλω να σ'ανησυχήσω, Πράκτορα Calavera...
gssa030	Αλλά έχεις δει ποτέ άνθρωπο ΑΝΘΙΣΜΕΝΟ;
gsma031	Πες μου ξανά την ιστορία με τα ανθίσματα!
gssa032	Δεν είναι παραμύθι για να κοιμίζεις τα παιδάκια, Manuel...
gsma033	Κοίτα, πρέπει να μου ανοίξεις την πόρτα, amigo.
gsma034	’ντε χάσου, θύμα. Δε μου χρειάζονται οι φλυαρίες τώρα.
gssa035	Χμμμ... Βλέπω ότι είσαι ακόμα πολύ θυμωμένος, φίλε μου.
gssa036	Θα ξανάρθω όταν θα έχεις ηρεμήσει λιγάκι.
gsma037	Ναι, ε λοιπόν έχω κάτι που μπορούν να βάλουν στο μαντρί τους...
gssa038	Πρέπει να προσπαθήσεις περισσότερο Manuel.
gssa039	Η πίστη ενός ανθρώπου καθορίζει το πεπρωμένο του.
gsma040	Είμαι ακόμη αφοσιωμένος στο ΥπΘαν, είτε το πιστεύεις είτε όχι.
gssa041	Χμμμ...Καλό παιδί.
gssa042	Εσύ απλά κράτα αυτό το χαρακτήρα, και είμαι σίγουρος ότι αρκετά σύντομα θα βγεις από δω μέσα.
gsma043	Το ΥπΘαν κάνει βρώμικο παιχνίδι, και σκοπεύω να τ'αποδείξω.
gssa044	Θα το έκανες αυτό;
gssa045	Αυτό μπορεί να προκαλέσει προβλήματα σ'αυτήν την αντιπροσωπεία...
gssa046	Σ'άκουσα και νωρίτερα να λες απειλές νευριασμένος.
gssa047	Η ερώτηση είναι, θα ήθελες στ'αλήθεια να βλάψεις το ΥπΘαν;
gsma048	Κοίτα, έκανα ότι έκανα. Και τι έγινε;
gsma049	Δε λέω τίποτα μέχρι να έρθει εδώ ο δικηγόρος μου.
gssa050	Δικηγόρος;
gssa051	Χα χα χα!
gssa052	Ω, Manny, αυτό είναι πολύ πνευματώδες.
gsma053	Όχι, δεν πηγαίνω πια σ'αυτά τα πάρτυ.
gssa054	Τότε δεν ξέρεις...
gsma055	Ναι, νομίζω ότι ήταν την εβδομάδα των προσλήψεων.
gssa056	Τότε ξέρεις...
gsma057	Ναι, είδα έναν μποξέρ να βγάζει ένα κουνουπίδι στ'αυτί κάποτε...
gsma058	Τι εννοείς, "ανθισμένο;"
gssa059	...δεν υπάρχει τίποτα πιο φρικτό από τη μόλυνση του "ανθιστή".
gssa060	Το θανατηφόρο του κεντρί εξαπλώνει μια πράσινη ασθένεια σε κάθε πόρο του σώματος σου...
gssa061	...αφήνοντας σε με ρίζες αντί για φλέβες και γρασίδι αντί για μαλλιά...
gssa062	...που σταθερά αναπτύσσονται και γίνονται όλο και πιο παχιά μέχρι που συνθλίβεσαι και λουλουδιάζεις...
gssa063	...σε ένα φρικιαστικό μπουκέτο από πόνο και ευωδιαστή δυστυχία...
gssa064	...να ουρλιάζεις μέχρι το στόμα σου να γεμίσει με πέταλα και τα ρουθούνια σου να πετάξουν αγκάθινα κλαδιά...
gssa065	...και οι βολβοί να βλαστήσουν μέσα στα μάτια σου...
gssa066	...ώσπου το μόνο που απομένει τελικά, είναι λίγα αγριολούλουδα στο έδαφος, και ένα σμήνος από πεταλούδες.
gsma067	Τέλειωσες;
gssa068	Ναι.
gsma069	Όχι, δεν το έχω δει ποτέ αυτό.
gsma070	Λατρεύω αυτή την ιστορία.
gsma071	Θα ανατινάξω αυτό το μέρος!
gssa072	Νεαρέ, είσαι εχθρός του ΥπΘαν!
gssa073	Καλωσήρθες στην ομάδα!
gsma074	Βασικά, όχι. Αλλά είμαι θυμωμένος.
gssa075	Μάλιστα. Λοιπόν, διατήρησε την πίστη σου.
gsma076	Το μόνο που θέλω είναι να με ξαναπάρουν στη δουλειά!

dodo028	Ω, ναι φυσικά, Manny...
dodo029	...αλλά αν οι πωλήσεις σου είναι χαμηλές, θα έπρεπε να το ρίξεις στη δουλειά, όχι στο ποτό.
doma030	Απλά πέρασα να δω τι γίνεται. Τα λέμε!
dodo031	Ωραία.
dodo032	Θα 'πρεπε να το κάνουμε συχνότερα.
doma033	Λοιπόν, τα λέμε στον "Ενδιάμεσο Τόπο"!

dodo035	Χαρά μου, Cal.
doma036	Λοιπόν, τι εξυπνάδα ήταν αυτή που έστειλες τον οδηγό μου σπίτι;
dodo037	Ειλικρινά, Manny, ξαφνιάζομαι που το παρατήρησες.
dodo038	Δεν τον χρησιμοποιούσες καθόλου τελευταία.

doma042	Μπορώ να έχω έναν απ'τους πελάτες σου;
dodo043	Βεβαίως, Cal.
dodo044	Μόλις μου δώσουν κάποιον που θεωρώ ότι μπορείς να αναλάβεις...
doma045	Μπορώ ν' αντιμετωπίσω οτιδήποτε.
doma046	Ειδικά αν αυτό είναι το καλό σου "δεξί".
doma047	Γιατί παίρνεις όλους τους καλούς πελάτες;
dodo048	Ρωτάς λάθος άνθρωπο.
dodo049	Θα'πρεπε να ρίξεις μια καλή ματιά στον άνθρωπο στον καθρέφτη.

doma051	Τι έκανες για να πάρεις αυτή τη δουλειά;
dodo052	Εννοείς, ποιό είναι το μυστικό της επιτυχίας μου;
doma053	Όχι, εννοώ πώς τα θαλάσσωσες και ξέμεινες εδώ στο ΥπΘαν;
doma054	Τι αμαρτία έκανες και πόσο καιρό θα χρειαστεί να δουλεύεις για να την ξεπληρώσεις;
dodo055	Θα μπορούσα εύκολα να ρωτήσω το ίδιο και σε σένα.
doma056	Μα εγώ δεν ξέρω την απάντηση. Ακόμα δεν ξέρω τι έκανα.

dodo061	Ουπς! Συνέχεια το ξεχνάω.
dodo062	Δεν έχεις πάει στο πανεπιστήμιο, έτσι;
doma063	Λοιπόν, αυτά είναι όλα όσα ήθελα να ρωτήσω. Για τώρα.
dodo064	Λοιπόν, μικρέ, έλα πίσω όταν θελήσεις να συνεχίσεις την εκπαίδευσή σου.
doma065	Ξέρεις, αυτό ήταν το γραφείο μου.
dodo066	Ναι, το ξέρω.

dodo072	Χε χε.
doma073	Νομίζω ότι θα'πρεπε να γίνουμε ομάδα. Συνεργάτες.
dodo074	Ω, Manny, θα το έκανα, αλλά είμαι πολύ φοβισμένος.
dodo075	Ποτέ δε θα μπορούσα να γίνω συνεργάτης με κάποιον που είναι τόσο περισσότερο άντρας από μένα.
doma076	Ω, έλα τώρα.

tuma088	Έχει γεμίσει εκεί μέσα ο τόπος με το ανοιχτόχρωμο χημικό.
tuma089	Ο διακόπτης φαίνεται να έχει βρωμίσει.
tuma090	Είναι ο πολύπλοκος και ευαίσθητος κόμβος όλων των επικοινωνιών εδώ στο Υπουργείο Θανάτου.
tuma091	Έχω σαν κανόνα, ποτέ να μην αγγίζω κάτι πιο πολύπλοκο και ευαίσθητο από μένα.

tuma001	Γεια. Δε δέχομαι μηνύματα. Έχει πέσει το δίκτυο;
tubs002	Αυτό το θεωρούν φάρσα;
tubs003	Το βρίσκουν αστείο;
tubs004	Θα ήθελα να γεμίσω τους δικούς τους σωλήνες με υλικά πακεταρίσματος, να δω αν θα τους αρέσει!
tuma005	Έι, ακόμα δεν παίρνω μηνύματα.
tubs006	Σου δίνω ένα τώρα, αλλά δε βλέπεις το χέρι μου.
tuma007	Λοιπόν, λες ότι το δίκτυο έπεσε, σωστά;
tubs008	Το δίκτυο δεν έπεσε, ποτέ δεν ΠΕΦΤΕΙ.
tubs009	Απλά είναι προσωρινά μη διαθέσιμο ενόσω κάνω λίγο συντήρηση, αυτό είναι όλο.
tuma010	Λοιπόν, για πόσο καιρό θα είναι πεσμένο;
tubs011	Με αυτή τη δουλειά ποτέ δεν ξέρεις.
tubs012	Πιθανόν ώρες.
tuma013	Ή μέχρι να μην υπάρχει κανείς τριγύρω να σε δει να φεύγεις, έτσι;
tubs014	Οποιοδήποτε συμβεί πρώτο.
tuma015	Μπορώ να στριμωχτώ λίγο εκεί μέσα, για ένα λεπτάκι μόνο;
tubs016	Πλάκα μου κάνεις;
tubs017	Αυτή είναι περιοχή υψηλής ασφάλειας.
tubs018	Κανείς δεν επιτρέπεται εδώ μέσα που να μην είναι εγώ.
tuma019	Τι το ιδιαίτερο έχεις εσύ;
tubs020	Εγώ, κύριε, είμαι ένα πνεύμα της φύσης που κλήθηκα στη ζωή από την ίδια τη Γη των Νεκρών...
tuma021	Ναι, ναι, άσε να μαντέψω...
tuma022	Σου δόθηκε ένας σκοπός, μια ικανότητα, μια επιθυμία: να επισκευάζεις σωλήνες μηνυμάτων που λειτουργούν με αέρα;
tubs023	Όχι, δημιουργήθηκα για να λειτουργώ το ασανσέρ, αλλά μετά έβαλαν αυτούς τους αναθεματισμένους ανιχνευτές κίνησης...
tubs024	...και έμεινα άνεργος!
tuma025	Τι είναι όλα αυτά στους τοίχους;
tubs026	Είναι αυτές οι καρκινογενετικές ακαθαρσίες που βάζουν μέσα πτώματα στο δωμάτιο απέναντι.
tubs027	Σκλήρυναν στους σωλήνες σαν μεγάλο δείπνο με τσίλι.
tuma028	Ποιός θα έκανε κάτι τόσο τρομερό;
tubs029	Είναι αυτοί οι αλήτες απ'το ταχυδρομείο!
tubs030	Πιστεύουν ότι αυτό το μωρό θα τους κάνει να χάσουν τη δουλειά τους..
tubs031	Και έχουν δίκιο!
tuma032	Ξέρεις, πιστεύω πραγματικά ότι είναι αρκετά καθαρό.
tubs033	Ω, είναι αρκετά καθαρό για να λειτουργήσει βεβαίως.
tubs034	Απλά χασομεράω εδώ μέσα για ασφάλεια, ξέρεις...
tubs035	Πρέπει να καλύψω τον κώλο μου!
tuma036	Ναι πρέπει.
tuma037	Καθαρή περιέργεια--Πώς μπήκες εκεί μέσα;
tubs038	Στριμώχτηκα μέσα σ'αυτούς τους σωλήνες, σαν νεραϊδούλα!
tubs039	Εσύ δηλαδή πώς νομίζεις ότι μπήκα;
tubs040	Απ' την πόρτα, όπως και εσύ!
tuma041	Λοιπόν, να του δίνω.
tubs042	(γρύλισμα)
tubs043	Να σου πω, ε, Κυρία Πολυλογού...
tubs044	Έχω πολλή δουλειά εδώ πέρα...
tuma045	Έι, και εγώ. Σε αφήνω.
hqsa102	Είσαι φίλος της επανάστασης, Πράκτορα Calavera, και τώρα...
hqsa103	...άσε με να σε εξυπηρετήσω και εγώ.
hqtx104	Salvador
hqma105	Ο Salvador φαίνεται να αυτοσυγκεντρώνεται.
hqma106	Μπορεί να μας καβαλήσει ΑΦΟΥ κερδίσει τον πόλεμο.
hqsa107	ΕΞΟΧΑ, Manuel!
hqsa108	Με αυτά, μπορώ να αναθρέψω έναν ολόκληρο ΣΤΡΑΤΟ από φτερωτούς αγγελιοφόρους!
hqsa109	Η επανάσταση μας μπορεί τώρα να εξαπλωθεί και σε άλλα μέρη, υποβασταζόμενη από τα φεγγοβόλα φτερά της δικαιοσύνης, χάρη σε σένα...
hqsa110	...Πράκτορα Calavera!
hqma111	Και εγώ ο ίδιος, θα ήθελα, επίσης, να "εξαπλωθώ" σ' άλλα μέρη...
hqsa112	Αλλά δε μπορείς. Χρειαζόμαστε τα οδοντικά σου αποτυπώματα εδώ ώστε να έχουμε πρόσβαση στον υπολογιστή.
hqsa113	Συγγνώμη, αλλά η ελευθερία έχει το τίμημα της!
hqsa114	Δεν ξέρω τι να το κάνω αυτό.
hqsa115	Γιατί δεν το δείχνεις στην αξιωματικό κατασκοπείας μου;
hqtx116	Eva
hqma117	Είναι της γραμματέας του αφεντικού μου η κακιά δίδυμη!
hqev118	Απλά εγώ, γλυκέ μου.
hqma119	Λοιπόν, υποθέτω ότι θα μπορούσα, τώρα που δε δουλεύουμε πια μαζί.
hqev120	Ω θα δουλέψουμε ξανά μαζί, αν θέλεις τη βοήθεια μας για να φύγεις από εδώ.
hqev121	Ωωω, δείξ'τα αυτά στον Salvador!
hqev122	Manny, αυτό δείχνει σαν ένα τέλειο αποτύπωμα των δοντιών σου.
hqev123	Μπορούμε να το χρησιμοποιήσουμε σαν καλούπι για να φτιάξουμε ένα σετ από ψεύτικα δόντια, και να μπούμε στον υπολογιστή με αυτό τον τρόπο.
hqsa124	Καλή δουλειά στρατιώτη.
hqma125	Θα με οδηγήσεις τώρα έξω από εδώ;
hqsa126	Αμέσως μόλις μου φέρεις εκείνα τα αυγά.
hqev127	Ωωω, τι είναι αυτό; Γαλατόπιτα;
hqma128	Δοκίμασε το.
hqev129	Όχι ευχαριστώ. Προσέχω τη σιλουέτα μου.
hqev130	Τι είναι αυτό;
hqma131	Το επιστόμιο του Domino. Λες να μπορείς να κάνεις ένα αποτύπωμα δοντιών απ' αυτό;
hqev132	Όχι, το πλαστικό είναι τόσο σκληρό που δεν άφησε κανένα σημάδι.
hqtx133	plans
hqma134	Δεν καταλαβαίνω.
hqsa135	Ούτε και εγώ Manuel, όχι ακόμα.
hqma136	Θα ανέβαζα μια παράσταση κάνοντας σκιές με το χέρι μου τώρα, αλλά δεν νιώθω ότι υπάρχει διάθεση.
hqtx137	slide projector
hqma138	Είναι ένας προβολέας για διαφάνειες.

hqma142	Που πάει αυτό;

hqsa144	Ανοίγει μόνο για μέλη της ΣΧΨ.
hqma145	Δεν κουνιέται.

hqma147	Αυτός ο υπολογιστής είναι κλειστός.
hqsa148	Μαζέψαμε αυτή τη μονάδα όταν η εταιρία την πέταξε, αλλά δεν έχουμε καταφέρει να την κάνουμε να δουλέψει ακόμα.
hqsa149	Όταν τα καταφέρουμε, θα σε χρειαστούμε για να μπούμε στο σύστημα.
hqma150	Θα έχω φύγει μακριά μέχρι τότε.
hqsa151	Θα δούμε, Manuel.
hqtx152	elevator
hqma153	Αυτός είναι ο ανελκυστήρας για πάνω.
hqma045	Κοίτα, πήρες τα αυγά που ήθελες, μπορώ να φύγω τώρα;
hqsa046	Συγγνώμη, αλλά τα δόντια σου... η επανάσταση στηρίζεται στα δόντια σου.
hqma047	Έχεις σκεφτεί να χρησιμοποιήσεις μηνύματα δεμένα σε μπαλόνια; Μπορώ να σου βρω μπόλικα μπαλόνια.
hqma048	Μπορώ να σου βρω μπόλικα μπαλόνια.
hqsa049	ΠΕΡΙΣΤΕΡΙΑ, Manuel, φέρε μου τα ΑΥΓΑ τους!
hqma050	Ουφ, εντάξει.
hqma051	Έχω κανά-δυό πράγματα να συζητήσουμε...
hqma052	’νοιξε την πόρτα, Sal, έχω να πάω σε διάφορα μέρη.
hqsa053	Αυτό σημαίνει πως είσαι έτοιμος να γίνεις μέλος;
hqma054	Εντάξει, είμαι μέσα. Τι πρέπει να κάνω;
hqma055	Δεν γίνομαι μέλος. Απλά άνοιξε την καταπακτή και ας χωρίσουμε σαν φίλοι.
hqsa056	Λυπάμαι, αλλά εδώ έχουμε πόλεμο, Manuel.
hqsa057	Και εσύ είσαι ο πρώτος που στρατολογείται.
hqma058	Ξέρεις κάτι που δεν ξέρω;
hqsa059	Έχεις αναρωτηθεί ποτέ γιατί οι πελάτες σου, ακόμα και οι ΚΑΛΥΤΕΡΟΙ πελάτες σου...
hqsa060	...ποτέ δε φαίνονται άξιοι για τα πακέτα που εσύ ξέρεις πως αξίζουν;
hqma061	Ναι, η τελευταία πελάτης μου συγκεκριμένα... η Meche.
hqsa062	Λοιπόν, όλοι ΗΤΑΝ άξιοι, Manuel. Ιδίως εκείνη.
hqsa063	Αλλά κάπως, κάποιος με πρόσβαση στα αρχεία έκλεψε τις δίκαιες ανταμοιβές τους, τη γλυκιά τους μετά θάνατον ζωή...
hqma064	Τα εισιτήρια τους για το Νούμερο Εννέα;
hqsa154	Precisamente, amigo. (Ακριβώς, φίλε μου.)
hqma066	Τι θα έκαναν με τα εισιτήρια;
hqsa067	Ένα εισιτήριο για το Νούμερο Εννέα είναι σαν ένα φύλλο χρυσού, Manuel.
hqsa068	Ιδιαίτερα για κάποιον που πέθανε με ένα όχι-και-τόσο-καλό αρχείο.
hqsa069	Κάποιος εδώ βγάζει κέρδος από αυτούς που θα εξαγόραζαν την είσοδο τους στον παράδεισο.
hqma070	Μα τα λεφτά δεν είναι σημαντικά εδώ. Απλά όλοι θέλουμε να φύγουμε.
hqsa071	ΕΣΥ θέλεις να φύγεις, Manuel, και το ίδιο και εγώ κάποια μέρα.
hqsa072	Αλλά για κάποιους ανθρώπους, αυτός ο κόσμος είναι ότι υπάρχει.
hqsa073	Αποφάσισαν να αναζητήσουν την απόλαυση και την ευτυχία εδώ στον Όγδοο ’δη, και γι' αυτό, χρειάζεσαι λεφτά.
hqma074	Δηλαδή ποιοι εμπλέκονται σ' αυτή την ιστορία;
hqsa075	Ο Don Copal είχε την πρόσβαση--μπορούσε να ανοίξει οποιονδήποτε λογαριασμό και να μεταφέρει ένα δελτίο παραλαβής εισιτηρίου σε κάποιον άλλο.
hqsa076	Πιστεύουμε ότι θα ανέθετε τότε την υπόθεση στον Domino Hurley, ο οποίος θα κάλυπτε τα ίχνη τους...
hqma077	’ρα αυτός ο menso (εγκληματίας), ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙ αναλάμβανε όλους τους καλούς πελάτες!
hqsa078	Ανέλαβες και εσύ κάποιους, Manuel, απλά δεν το ήξερες.
hqsa079	Ο Domino αναλάμβανε μια υπόθεση μόνο όταν ο χαρακτήρας του πελάτη ήταν προφανέστατα άξιος...
hqma080	Όπως της Meche...
hqma081	Ξέρεις ποιός βρίσκεται πίσω απ' όλα αυτά;
hqsa082	Ο Copal και ο Hurley δεν μπορεί να τα έκαναν όλα μόνοι τους, χωρίς βοήθεια από τα κεντρικά.
hqsa083	Υπάρχει ένας δυνατός παίχτης σ' αυτό το παιχνίδι, που η ταυτότητα του παραμένει μυστήριο για μένα.
hqma084	Τι θέλεις από μένα;
hqsa085	Σκοπεύω να χτίσω έναν μυστικό στρατό από ψυχές για να πολεμήσει την αδικία που έχω δει στο El Marrow.
hqsa086	Η επικοινωνία θα είναι ζωτικής σημασίας όταν η Συμμαχία των Χαμένων Ψυχών εξαπλωθεί.
hqsa087	Θα χρειαστούμε έμπιστους αγγελιοφόρους.
hqma088	Θέλεις να γίνω αγγελιοφόρος σου;
hqsa089	Όχι, Manuel. Οι δυνάμεις μας είναι περιορισμένες και οι πράκτορες μας είναι ιδιαίτερα πολύτιμοι για να τους ρισκάρουμε σε τέτοιου είδους δουλειές.
hqsa090	Η ιστορία μας δείχνει πως μόνο ένας αγγελιοφόρος μπορεί να φανεί χρήσιμος για ένα σκοπό σαν το δικό μας:
hqsa091	ΤΑΧΥΔΡΟΜΙΚΑ ΠΕΡΙΣΤΕΡΙΑ!
hqma092	Αν αρπάξω μερικά περιστέρια απ' την στέγη, θα με αφήσεις να φύγω;
hqsa093	Όχι, πρέπει να τα αναθρέψω απ' τη γέννηση τους, Πράκτορα Calavera--
hqsa094	Πρέπει να μου φέρεις τα αυγά τους!
hqma095	Με κρατάς εδώ επειδή χρειάζεσαι τα αυγά;
hqsa096	Γιατί είσαι ακόμα εδώ, Calavera;
hqsa097	Πήγαινε φέρε μου μια πολεμική αεροπορία προτού εκκολαφθεί!
hqma098	Έφυγα.
hqsa099	Στο καλό, Πράκτορα Calavera, και...
hqsa100	Τώρα, αυτά είναι όλες οι οδηγίες που χρειάζεσαι, στρατιώτη!
hqsa101	Viva la Revolucion!
hqma001	Λοιπόν, δεν είσαι στ' αλήθεια γραμματέας;
hqev002	Είμαι κατάσκοπος, Manny.
hqma003	Λοιπόν, αυτή ήταν η τελευταία φορά που χρησιμοποιούμε αυτή την αντιπροσωπεία.
hqma004	Γιατί δε με βοηθάς;
hqev005	Χρειάζομαι τα δόντια σου, θυμάσαι;
hqma006	Ανέφερα ότι ήταν υπέροχο να δουλεύω μαζί σου;
hqev007	Ομοίως, μικρέ.
hqma008	Έχω μια κατασκευαστική δουλειά εδώ που θέλω να σου δείξω.
hqma009	Κανένα μήνυμα για μένα;
hqev010	Ναι: "Συμμάχησε ή Πέθανε!"
hqma011	Μα είμαι ήδη--
hqev012	Ξανά!
hqma013	Eva, πρέπει να με βγάλεις από την πόλη. Θα με ανθίσουν!
hqev014	Δεν μπορείς να φύγεις, Manny.
hqev015	Χρειαζόμαστε πρόσβαση στο δίκτυο υπολογιστών του ΥπΘαν αν θέλουμε ποτέ ν' ανακαλύψουμε τι συμβαίνει.
hqev016	Και δεν έχουμε πρόσβαση χωρίς έναν πωλητή σαν εσένα. Ο υπολογιστής σε αναγνωρίζει όταν συνδέεσαι.
hqma017	Πώς το κάνει αυτό;
hqma018	Δαχτυλικά αποτυπώματα;
hqma019	Δεν έχω!
hqev020	Τα δόντια σου, Manny. Δεν πρόσεξες ποτέ ότι ο υπολογιστής σου σκανάρει τα δόντια όταν συνδέεσαι;
hqma021	Νόμιζα ότι ήταν απλά το απότομο ανέβασμα της τάσης του ρεύματος.
hqev022	Χρειαζόμαστε τα δόντια σου Manny, δεν μπορούμε να σ' αφήσουμε να φύγεις.
hqev023	Λυπάμαι.
hqma024	Ο Copal δεν αναρωτιέται που βρίσκεσαι;
hqev025	Ο Don και ο Domino είναι κλειδωμένοι στο γραφείο του Don μαζί με κάποιον σπουδαίο απ' τα κεντρικά.
hqev026	Έναν χοντρό με φέσι.
hqsa027	Χμμμμ.  Ποιός είναι ο χοντρός άντρας, αναρωτιέμαι, και πώς μπλέκεται σ' αυτό το μοχθηρό παζλ;
hqev028	Τέλος πάντων, μη σου μπαίνουν ιδέες για επιδρομές στα ποτά του Domino.
hqev029	Χρειαζόμαστε νηφάλιους στρατιώτες.
hqma030	Σωστά.
hqma031	Εδώ και πόσο καιρό είσαι κατάσκοπος;
hqev032	Ο Salvador με επιστράτευσε πριν ένα χρόνο περίπου.
hqev033	Δε μπορούσα να του αντισταθώ--είναι τόσο... μεγαλοπρεπής!
hqma034	Σε τι εργάζεσαι εκεί;
hqev035	Προσπαθώ να φτιάξω αυτό το ράδιο, ώστε να το χρησιμοποιήσουμε στο πεδίο.
hqev036	Αλλά φαίνεται μάταιο.
hqev037	Ο Salvador έχει δίκιο--χρειαζόμαστε καλά παλαιομοδίτικα ταχυδρομικά περιστέρια για να επικοινωνούμε με τους πράκτορες μας στο πεδίο. 
hqma038	Έχετε πράκτορες στο πεδίο;
hqev039	Όχι, είμαστε μόνο ο Sal και εγώ αυτή τη στιγμή, αλλά κάποια μέρα, Manny...
hqma040	Φεύγω.
hqev041	Δώσε τις σωστές μάχες, μωρό μου.
hqma042	Λοιπόν, δε θα με βοηθήσεις να φύγω;
hqev043	Λυπάμαι. Θα βοηθήσω ΕΣΕΝΑ, αλλά όχι τα δόντια σου.
hqev044	Σκέψου το.
rfma054	Ναι, δίνετε του απαίσια μικρά μαρκιζοψωριάρικα!
rfma044	Έι!
rfma045	Πρόσεχε!
rfma046	Πάρ'τα από πάνω μου!
rfma047	Κάντε πίσω, πουλιά!
rfma048	Σας προειδοποιώ μικρές "κεραμιδόκοτες", δείξτε λίγο σεβασμό.
rfma049	Όχι το κοστούμι! Είναι το τελευταίο μου!
rfma050	Αααα!
rftx002	ladder
rftx003	dish
rfma004	Μόνο κανα-δυό ψίχουλα και ίχνη από latex.
rfma005	Α--στα περιστέρια προφανώς αρέσει αυτός ο αγωγός.
rfma006	Υπάρχει ένα όχι-πολύ-τρομακτικό μπαλόνι εκεί μέσα.
rfma007	Υπάρχει κάτι εκεί μέσα.
rfma008	Είναι μέρος της οροφής!
rfma009	Προτιμώ να τρώω από καθαρά πιάτα που δεν είναι καρφωμένα στην οροφή.
rfma010	Νομίζω πως θα' πρέπει να φύγω από δω με αυτά τα αυγά πριν αυτοί οι γύπες αγωγών ξαναγυρίσουν.
rfma011	Ίσως αυτό τους τρομάξει... Τελικά.
rftx012	eggs
rfma013	Αυτά τα μωρά θα πάνε στον πόλεμο!
rfma014	Τα τρώω μόνο σιγοβρασμένα.
rfma015	Δε θέλω να τα σπάσω!
rftx016	nest
rfma017	Ώστε από εδώ ήρθαν τα παράσιτα.
rfma018	Πωπω, αυτά τα περιστέρια κι αν θα σημαδευτούν!
rfma019	Πρέπει να έρθετε μαζί μου μικρά μου, γιατί εγώ, είμαι ο Θεριστής των Ψυχών.
rfma020	Ο Salvador είναι ο μπαμπάς σας τώρα.
rftx021	pigeons
rfma022	Δε μου αρέσει η εμφάνιση αυτών των περιστεριών.
rfma023	Βρίσκονται παντού!
rfma024	Νομίζω πως με κοιτάνε.
rfma025	Φαίνεται να καταστρώνουν κάποιο σχέδιο.
rfma026	Αν μου επιτεθούν όλα μαζί, μπορούν να με κουβαλήσουν μακριά και δε θα ξανακούσει ποτέ κανείς για μένα.
rfma027	Δεν έχω δίχτυ, ή την επιθυμία να έχω περιστέρι για κατοικίδιο.
rfma028	Επιπλέον, ο Salvador θέλει να τα αναθρέψει από τη ΓΕΝΝΗΣΗ τους.
rfma029	Ξου!
rfma030	Χμμμ. Δε φαίνονται τρομαγμένα.
rfma031	Νομίζω μάλιστα πως γελάνε με μένα.
rfma032	Μπορεί να μην ξέρουν πόσο τρομακτικότερος είναι ένας αυστραλιανός σκύλος από έναν κανονικό.
rfma033	Τρέξτε βρε περιστέρια! Είναι ο Robert Frost!
rfma034	Κοιτάτε αυτή την γυαλιστερή πέτρα και αισθάνεστε τα βλέφαρα σας να βαραίνουν...
rfma035	...να βαραίνουν πολύ...
rfma036	Μα τι είστε; Υπερβολικά ηλίθια για να υπνωτιστείτε;
rfma037	Αυτό θα τους τρομάξει...
rfma038	Ατρόμητα μικρά ομιχλοπιτσούνια.
rfma039	Μη με αναγκάσετε να σας ακουμπήσω μ' αυτό!
rfma040	Είναι γεμάτο με τα μικρόβια του Domino Hurley επάνω του!
rfma041	Νομίζω ότι μόνο τον εαυτό μου τρομάζω.
rfma042	Αν απλά τους το δώσω, είμαι υπόλογος για να χάσω ένα δάχτυλο ή δύο.

sgma058	Αν ήμουν Σκοτσέζος, ίσως να μπορούσα να παίξω κάτι σ' αυτό, αλλά δεν είμαι.
sgma059	Αυτή η καρδιά ανήκει στον Glottis, πουθενά αλλού.
sgma060	Θα ήταν πιο καθαρή αν την σήκωνα με τα χέρια μου.
sgtx061	Bone Wagon
sgma062	Δεν αστειευόταν--πραγματικά λατρεύει την οδήγηση!
sgma063	Λέει, "Bone (κόκαλο) Wagon" στα πλάγια.
sgma065	Δεν είναι τρόπος αυτός για να φερθείς στο Bone Wagon.
sgma066	Νομίζω ότι τα μόνα κόκαλα που θα έπρεπε να μεταφέρει αυτό το πράγμα, είναι τα δικά μου.

sggl069	Δεν οδηγώ πίσω στην πόλη, Manny!
sgma070	Δεν μπορώ να αφήσω τον Glottis ξαπλωμένο εδώ. Μπορεί να πεθαίνει!

sgma076	Πώς θα περάσω το Bone Wagon πάνω από αυτούς τους ογκόλιθους;
sgma077	Θα μπορούσα να το πάω με τα πόδια, αλλά δεν θα τα κατάφερνα ποτέ να διασχίσω όλο το δάσος μ' αυτό τον τρόπο...
sgma078	Αυτός ο δρόμος είναι γεμάτος ογκόλιθους.
sggl079	Manny, αυτό είναι αμάξι δρόμου με χαμηλό αμάξωμα, όχι τέσσερα επί τέσσερα!
sggl080	Δεν υπάρχει το διάκενο για τέτοιο δρόμο.
sggl081	Σου λέω Manny, δεν υπάρχει το διάκενο για τέτοιο δρόμο.

sgma083	Υπάρχει ένα ξέφωτο ευθεία μπροστά.

spma002	Αυτές οι αράχνες έχουν την καρδιά του Glottis στον ιστό τους!
spma003	Και ένα κόκαλο, αλλά αυτό είναι δικό μου λάθος.

spma005	Ω, καημένες αράχνες. Δεν έχει πια καρδιά δαιμόνιου να φάτε.

trgl004	Manny, κοίτα αυτό το καροτσάκι, έτσι;
trgl005	Με ένα ζευγάρι ειδικά ATV λάστιχα στις πίσω ρόδες και μια μηχανή κουρέματος γκαζόν, μπορούμε να φτιάξουμε ένα ΚΑΛΟ go-cart!

trgl007	Ωωω, προσοχή, Manny.
trgl008	Με τον αρμονικό ισορροπιστή κλειστό, αυτές οι αντλίες πιθανώς να ρίξουν το δέντρο ταρακουνώντας το.
trgl009	Ω! Μα!
trgl010	Ω!
trgl011	Αν ρίξουμε το δέντρο, αυτές οι αντλίες θα αποκολληθούν, και θα μπορούσα να φτιάξω ανυψωτικά αμορτισέρ για το Bone Wagon!

trgl018	Εντάξει, τελευταία φορά.
trgl019	Αυτό ήταν βρώμικο κόλπο, Manny!

rema035	Μπορώ να ρωτήσω--τι ΕΙΝΑΙ κάτω από το κάλυμμα;

reve037	Ω, λοιπόν, όταν ήμουν ζωντανός είχα ένα κάλυμμα σαν αυτό...
reve038	...αυτό είναι απλά για τον υποτιθέμενο πόνο...
reve039	Και η υποδοχή του ματιού ούρλιαζε σαν στρίγγλα όταν οι αληγείς άνεμοι φυσούσαν, γι'αυτό την τάπωσα.
regl040	Λοιπόν, στην ουσία είναι αυτοκίνητο παραγωγής, με μερικές τροποποιήσεις εδώ και εκεί...
reve041	Λοιπόν αυτό που ακούω είναι γυάλινες εξατμίσεις ή τουρμπίνες;
regl042	Υπήρχε αυτός ο ψηλός κλαψουριστός ήχος που έκανε--πραγματικά βραχνός θόρυβος, κατάλαβες;
regl043	Και έψαξα, έψαξα, αλλά δεν μπόρεσα να βρω την πηγή του θορύβου, μέχρι που σταματήσαμε εδώ.

rima081	Για να μην πω για τη σάλτσα σόγιας--Πραγματικά δε χρειάζομαι άλλη.

rima002	Είμαι έτοιμος να σας πάρω τώρα.
rice003	Manny Calavera; Εσύ είσαι;
rice004	Δεν ήσουν...
rice005	ΨΗΛΟΤΕΡΟΣ;
rima006	Είσαι σίγουρος ότι δεν μπορώ να κοιμηθώ πίσω;
rice007	Υπάρχει χώρος μόνο για έναν.
rima008	Τι θα έλεγες για τη σοφίτα;
rice009	Αυτό είναι το γραφείο του αφεντικού. Μπορείς να κοιμηθείς εκεί όταν θα γίνεις αφεντικό.
rima010	Θα μπορούσα να κοιμηθώ εδώ έξω στον πάγκο.
rice011	Μπορεί οι πελάτες μας να είναι όλοι νεκροί, Manny, αλλά εξακολουθεί να μας νοιάζει η καθαριότητα.
rima012	Θα μπορούσα να κοιμηθώ κάτω από το νεροχύτη στην κουζίνα.
rice013	Τα ποντίκια θα σου κλέψουν τα δάχτυλα στον ύπνο σου.
rima014	Κοίτα, χρειάζομαι μια δουλειά και ένα μέρος να μείνω.
rice015	Σου είπα, μπορείς να πάρεις τη δική μου...
rice016	...όταν σταματήσω να περιμένω τη γυναίκα μου.
rima017	Ήρθα να ξαναπάρω αυτό το μπαστούνι.
rice018	Το έσπασα στο κεφάλι ενός σιχαμερού τέρατος στο δάσος.
rima019	Έμοιαζαν με μικρές πύρινες μπάλες με μεγάλα δόντια;
rice020	Ναι, αλλά δεν ήταν μικρά, και ΣΙΓΟΥΡΑ δεν υπήρχαν στις μπροσούρες σου.
rima021	Ψάχνω μια γυναίκα που λέγεται Mercedes Colomar.
rice022	Κανείς δεν πέρασε απ'την πόλη με αυτό το όνομα, στο λέω εγώ.
rice023	Και εγώ ψάχνω για κάποιον, γι'αυτό παρακολουθώ τι πάει κι έρχεται ΠΟΛΥ προσεκτικά.
rima024	Ποιόν ψάχνεις;
rice025	Αφού λοιπόν θέλεις να ξέρεις, πρόκειται για τη γυναίκα μου...
rice026	Έμαθα ότι πέθανε λίγο μετά από μένα, και ότι και εκείνη, διασχίζει τη Γη των Νεκρών με τα πόδια.
rice027	Λέγεται ότι όλες οι χαμένες ψυχές έρχονται στη Rubacava, γι'αυτό ήρθα εδώ να την περιμένω.
rima091	Πρέπει να την αγαπάς πάρα πολύ, Celso.
rice092	Ναι, αυτό είναι αλήθεια...
rice093	Φυσικά, έχει και όλα μου τα λεφτά...
rima028	Πως ξέρεις ότι η γυναίκα σου δεν έφτασε πριν από σένα και έφυγε;
rice029	Ωω, Manny--Αν είχε φτάσει εδώ πρώτη, ΣΙΓΟΥΡΑ θα με περίμενε!
rima030	Τι κάνεις εδώ;
rima031	Θα σε βοηθήσω να βρεις τη γυναίκα σου. Πες μου περίπου πως είναι;
rice032	Εε, εδώ.
rice033	Το πήρα από το ΥπΘαν, και έβγαλα αντίγραφα για να μοιράσω.
rice034	Δεν είναι ωραία;
rima035	Πρέπει να ήταν όμορφη με δέρμα.
rice036	Όλοι δεν ήμασταν;
rima037	Λοιπόν, ξέρεις κανένα καλό μέρος να μείνω στην πόλη;
rice038	Πόσα μπορείς να διαθέσεις;
rima039	Περίπου κάτι παραπάνω από τίποτα.
rice040	Τότε ίσως, νεαρέ, είναι ώρα να αρχίσεις να σκέφτεσαι να βρεις καμιά δουλειά.
rima041	Μπορείς να μου δώσεις εσύ μια δουλειά εδώ;
rice042	Καμία δεξιότητα έχεις;
rima043	Πωλήσεις.
rice044	Λοιπόν, αυτό σε κατατάσσει κατάλληλο για μια συγκεκριμένη θέση, αλλά...

rima046	Που μένεις;
rice094	Με αφήνουν να κοιμάμαι εδώ πίσω, ένα από τα πλεονεκτήματα της δουλειάς.
rima048	Ωραία δουλειά.
rima049	Υπάρχει καθόλου χώρος πίσω και για μένα;
rice050	Όχι στο μέρος μου, δίνε του.
rice051	Αλλά να σου πω, όταν εγώ και η γυναίκα μου φύγουμε απ'την πόλη, θα σου δώσω το μέρος που κοιμάμαι και τη σκούπα, ok;
rice052	Καιρός είναι να αποκτήσεις μια ΑΞΙΟΛΟΓΗ δουλειά.
rima053	Λοιπόν, καλύτερα να πάω να δω τι κάνουν οι άλλοι πελάτες μου...
rice054	Αφού το λες εσύ, Manny.
rice055	Με συγχωρείς τώρα Manuel, πρέπει να ετοιμάσω το μαγαζί γιατί σε λίγο ανοίγει...
rima056	Σωστά. Θα σε ειδοποιήσω αν δω τη γυναίκα σου.
rice057	Θα είναι κάποια που θα ρωτάει για τον αγαπημένο της Celso.
cfbo001	Αυτό είναι εξωφρενικό!

cfcr004	Όλα αυτά τα πράγματα ελέγχονται από τον τύπο στο πάνω πάτωμα.
cfbo059	Λοιπόν, σε παρακαλώ πες στον "τύπο επάνω" ότι ο αρχηγός της αστυνομίας ο Bogen ήταν πολύ συγχυσμένος όταν έφυγε...
cfbo007	...και όταν επιστρέψει αργότερα απόψε το βράδυ, θα προτιμούσε να έχει καλύτερη τύχη!
cfcr008	Oui, Monsieur. Bon soir.
cfcr009	Θα του το πω σίγουρα.
cfma010	Αχ, θεά τύχη!
cfma011	Πάντα είχα σκοπό να το κρύβω καλύτερα.

cfma014	Αχχ για ύπνο τώρα...

cfma016	Δεν μετακινώ έπιπλα όταν φοράω το σμόκιν μου.
cfma017	Δεν μπορώ. Και αν η Meche έρθει και δεν τη δω επειδή κοιμόμουν;
cfma060	Δεν μπορώ. Θα χάσω το πλοίο μου.
cftx018	letters
cfma019	Οι "Επικοινωνίες μου εν καιρώ πολέμου" από το Salvador...
cfma020	Μου στέλνει τέτοια μηνύματα εδώ και ένα χρόνο:
cfsa021	Πράκτορα Calavera, έμαθα ότι έφτασες καλά στην Rubacava.
cfsa022	Αυτό είναι πολύ καλό νέο, έτσι η υπηρεσία σου στη ΣΧΨ μπορεί τώρα να συνεχιστεί.
cfsa023	Έχω τη χαρά να αναφέρω την επιτυχή εκκόλαψη των αβγών που ελευθερώσατε.
cfsa024	Τα μικρά, που η Eva ονόμασε "Manny" και "Meche," είναι υγειή και ανυπομονούν να εξυπηρετήσουν το σκοπό μας.
cfsa025	Με λίγη τύχη, το επόμενο γράμμα μου θα είναι εν πτήση προς σένα με αυτά τα νεαρά ανάλαφρα φτερά της αλήθειας.
cfsa026	Για την επανάσταση,
cfsa027	--Salvador Limones.
cfsa028	Calavera, είναι όντως μια μεγάλη μέρα για την επανάσταση!
cfsa029	Πες hola στον μικρό Manny, τον πρώτο καταγεγραμμένο αγγελιοφόρο που υπηρετεί στη ΣΧΨ!
cfsa030	Σε παρακαλώ ταΐσε τον μερικά ψίχουλα και στείλε τον πίσω γρήγορα, ώστε να ξέρουμε ότι η πρώτη μας πτήση ήταν επιτυχής.
cfsa031	Manuel, λυπάμαι που δεν έχεις νέα από τον Meche σου.
cfsa032	Πρέπει να έχεις υπομονή, και να έχεις την καρδιά σου πάντα ανοιχτή.
cfsa033	Αν έτσι είναι να γίνει, κάποια μέρα θα ξανασμίξετε.
cfma034	Αχ, ακόμα νομίζει ότι είμαι ερωτευμένος μαζί της!
cfev035	Συγχαρητήρια, Manny!
cfev036	Η Sal και εγώ ήμασταν τόσο περήφανοι όταν μάθαμε για την προαγωγή σου!
cfev037	Πριν καλά καλά το καταλάβεις, θα γίνεις ο αρχιμάγειρας!
cfsa038	Manuel, βρήκαμε το κεφάλι το ερπετού!
cfsa039	Με τη βοήθεια της πρόσβασης στο computer που μας έδωσες, βρήκαμε μια άκρη που μας οδήγησε σε αυτόν που διέφθειρε το Τμήμα του Θανάτου!
cfsa040	Το όνομά του είναι Hector LeMans.
cfsa041	Ήταν κάποτε μικροκομπιναδόρος, μετά μεγαλοπιάστηκε και απέκτησε δύναμη κλέβοντας τους πρόσφατα πεθαμένους.
cfsa042	Έχε το νου σου για το όνομα Hector LeMans, Manuel, και να προσέχεις.
cfsa043	Αγαπητέ Φίλε,
cfsa044	Το κίνημά μας τώρα έχει αποκτήσει ορμή, και γινόμαστε όλο και περισσότεροι.
cfsa045	Αυτό οφείλεται κυρίως στα συστήματα επικοινωνιών και πληροφόρησης που διαθέτουμε, και τα δύο τα οφείλουμε σε σένα.
cfsa046	Προς ανταμοιβή για την προσφορά σου, θα ήθελα να ανακοινώσω την προαγωγή σου σε ΕΙΔΙΚΟ Πράκτορα.
cfsa047	Εγώ, ο Salvador Limones, της Συμμαχίας των Χαμένων Ψυχών, χαιρετίζω εσένα Manuel Calavera.
cfsa048	Είσαι ένας μεγάλος σύμμαχος σε αυτήν την ευγενή επανάσταση.
cfsa061	Φοβερά νέα -- ανακαλύψαμε ένα νέο, μυστικό ταλέντο των μικροσκοπικών μας αγγελιοφόρων!
cfsa062	Δεν ξέρουμε πως το κάνουν, αλλά αυτά τα μυστηριώδη πουλιά μπορούν πραγματικά να βρουν τους στόχους τους...
cfsa063	...ΑΠΛΑ ΚΟΙΤΑΖΟΝΤΑΣ ΜΙΑ ΦΩΤΟΓΡΑΦΙΑ του παραλήπτη.
cfsa064	Για να γιορτάσουμε, η Eva έφτιαξε σε όλα τους μικρούς μπερέδες--Θα σου στείλω μερικές φωτογραφίες!
cfsa049	Manuel, έχω προβληματιστεί από αναφορές ότι πρόκειται να αγοράσεις το automat και να το μετατρέψεις σε night club.
cfsa050	Είναι καλό για σένα που είσαι άνετα στην Rubacava για τη μακροχρόνια διαμονή σου, αλλά προσεύχομαι να μην έχεις ξεχάσει τους μεγαλύτερους στόχους...
cfsa051	Δεν είναι σε αυτόν τον κόσμο, αλλά στον επόμενο, εκεί βρίσκεται η αληθινή μας δόξα.
cfma052	Μόλις έλαβα αυτό:
cfsa053	Πρόσεχε Manuel, γιατί βρίσκεσαι σε θανάσιμο κίνδυνο!
cfsa054	Με κάποιο τρόπο η φήμη της παρουσίας σου στην Rubacava διαδόθηκε στους δρόμους του El Marrow.
cfsa055	Αν αυτή η πληροφορία φθάσει στον Hector LeMans, τότε σίγουρα θα στείλει τους κακούς συνεργάτες του πίσω σου.
cfsa056	Πρέπει να εγκαταλείψεις προσωρινά την έρευνά σου για την Mercedes, και σε παρακαλώ...
cfsa057	Φύγε από τη Rubacava με το επόμενο πλοίο!
cfma058	Νομίζω πως υπερβάλει λιγάκι όσον αφορά τον κίνδυνο, αλλά νιώθω ηλίθιος που έβαλα το όνομά μου στη μεγάλη ταμπέλα.
cclu001	Εϊ, αυτό είναι μια κάρτα από το καινούργιο μου σύστημα ελέγχου παλτών!

cclu016	Αυτό δεν μπορεί να είναι δικό σου!
ccma017	Αυτό είναι. Ευχαριστώ.
cclu018	Τι κάνεις με αυτό το κοριτσίστικο σακάκι;
ccma019	Δεν φαντάζομαι να υπήρχε καμιά κάμερα κάπου εκεί πίσω;
cclu020	Εμμ.... όχι.
ccma021	Πρέπει να την έκρυψε κάπου αλλού...
cclu022	Εε...
ccma023	Θα-Θα σου πω αύριο.
cclu024	Έχω ένα σημείωμα για σένα από τη Lola!
ccma025	Τη Lola;
cclu026	Ναι! Λοιπόν, που είναι;
cclu027	Που, που, που, που;
cclu028	Ωχ!
cclu029	Εδώ!
cclu030	Όχι.

cclu039	ΕΔΩ ΕΙΝΑΙ!
cclu040	Μια στιγμή... είναι άδειο.
cclu041	Υπήρχε κάτι μέσα, μου φάνηκε σαν κλειδί.
ccma042	Ένα κλειδί;
cclu043	Ναιιι!  Αλλά μήπως κάποιος ήλθε και σούφρωσε το κλειδί όσο τακτοποιούσα τα παλτά;
cclu044	Ποιος θα έκανε κάτι τέτοιο;
cclu045	Μου χάλασαν ΟΛΟΚΛΗΡΟ ΤΟ ΣΥΣΤΗΜΑ!!!

cclu048	Έλα εδώ!

ccma050	Φαίνεται ότι η Lupe το έριξε πάλι στη ζάχαρη.
ccma051	Όχι οι υπάλληλοί μου.
cclu052	Εϊ, βάζω στοίχημα ότι αυτό είναι το κλειδί από το σημείωμα της Lola.
cclu053	Δεν δοκιμάζω κλειδιά, Manny.
cclu054	Θα πρέπει να ορίσεις έναν οδηγό.
cclu055	Τριάντα έξι; Αυτός ο αριθμός δεν ανήκει καν στο σύστημά μου, Manny!
cclu056	Και δε νομίζω ότι θα άφηνα κάποιον να εξετάσει μια παλιά και σκουριασμένη άγκυρα (Rusty Anchor) εδώ πίσω, έτσι και αλλιώς.
ccma057	Είσαι έτοιμος.
cclu058	Οου!
cclu059	ΤΕΛΕΙΑ! ΚΑΤΣΕ ΝΑ ΣΟΥ ΦΕΡΩ ΜΙΑ ΚΑΡΤΑ...
ccma060	Μου έδωσες μια ήδη.
cclu061	ΤΙ; Τι νούμερο έχει επάνω;;;
ccma062	Δεν θυμάμαι. Την έχασα.
cclu063	ΑΑΑΑΑΑχχχ!
cclu064	ΠΡΟΣΠΑΘΕΙΣ ΝΑ ΜΕ ΤΡΕΛΑΝΕΙΣ;
ccma065	Ναι.
ccma066	Μόλις το πήρα αυτό το πράγμα!

ccma068	Είναι το σακάκι της Lola.
ccma069	Καημένη Lola. Να είχα την φωτογραφική της μηχανή ή εκείνο το film...
ccma070	Θα μπορούσα πραγματικά να πιάσω τον Nick.
ccma071	Δεν το κάνω αυτό με το σακάκι της Lola!
ccma072	Υπάρχει ένα κομμάτι χαρτί σε μια τσέπη...

ccma075	Το μόνο που γράφει αυτό το χαρτί είναι, "No. 36 - The Rusty Anchor."

cclu087	ΕΙΜΑΙ ΤΟΣΟ ΧΑΡΟΥΜΕΝΗ!!!
cclu088	ΠΡΕΠΕΙ ΝΑ ΣΟΥ ΠΩ ΓΙΑ ΤΟ ΝΕΟ ΜΟΥ ΣΥΣΤΗΜΑ ΤΑΚΤΟΠΟΙΗΣΗΣ ΠΑΛΤΩΝ!
ccma089	Νομίζεις ότι θα έρθει απόψε;
cclu090	Manny, μου το ρωτάς αυτό κάθε βράδυ...
cclu091	...τι θα έπρεπε να πω;
ccma092	Θα έπρεπε να πεις Ναι, "Ναι, νομίζω πως απόψε είναι η μεγάλη νύχτα."
cclu093	Ναι, νομίζω πως απόψε είναι η μεγάλη νύχτα...
cclu094	Που τελικά θα τρελαθείς από την αναμονή για τη μεγάλη είσοδο της Κυρίας Mercedes Colomar!
ccma095	Θα μπορούσες να είσαι λίγο περισσότερο ενθαρρυντική.
cclu096	Απλά δεν μου αρέσει να βλέπω να μεγαλώνουν έτσι οι ελπίδες σου κάθε νύχτα.
ccma097	Δεν την εγκαταλείπω.
ccma098	Τίποτα. Θα έπρεπε να μου πεις να το ξεπεράσω.
cclu099	Εϊ, δεν θέλω να χάσεις τις ελπίδες για την Mercedes...
cclu100	...απλά να έχεις πιο ρεαλιστικές προσδοκίες, αυτό είναι όλο.
ccma101	Ας το προσπαθήσουμε πάλι, εντάξει; Πιστεύεις ότι θα έρθει απόψε;
cclu102	ΝΑΙ! ΝΟΜΙΖΩ ΟΤΙ ΑΠΟΨΕ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΣΙΓΟΥΡΑ Η ΜΕΓΑΛΗ ΝΥΧΤΑ!
cclu103	Θα μπορούσε, Manny. Απλά περίμενε.
cclu104	Τίποτα. Ξεπέρασε το, χοντροκέφαλε!
ccma105	Σε ευχαριστώ.
ccma106	Ξέρεις, είναι δικό μου λάθος που είναι μόνη της μέσα στο δάσος.
cclu107	(αναστεναγμός)Αφού το λες εσύ, Manny.
ccma108	Ήρθε ο Bogen;
cclu109	Ναι, είναι κάτω στο καζίνο, πιθανότατα διασκεδάζει με τη συνηθισμένη του ρέντα.
ccma110	Ο Bogen φαινόταν έξαλλος όταν έφυγε;
cclu111	Ναι, τι συνέβη;
ccma112	Εϊ, όλους τους εγκαταλείπει η τύχη, τελικά.
cclu113	Πρόσεχε, Manny, αλλιώς θα μας κλείσεις το μαγαζί!
ccma114	Πως πάει η κίνηση απόψε;
cclu115	Νέκρα απόψε, Manny.
cclu116	Όλοι βρίσκονται στα σπίτια τους για την Μέρα των Νεκρών, πιστεύω...
cclu117	...εκτός από το καζίνο. Το καζίνο είναι γεμάτο.
cclu118	Γιατί συμβαίνει όλοι αυτοί οι άνθρωποι που δεν πάνε στο σπίτι τους, να είναι οι ίδιοι με αυτούς που λατρεύουν τον τζόγο;
ccma119	Φαντάζομαι πως όταν δεν έχεις τίποτα για το οποίο να γυρίσεις στο σπίτι, δεν έχεις και τίποτα να χάσεις.
cclu120	Εϊ, θα έπρεπε να βάλουμε αυτό κάτω από την πόρτα!
ccma121	Είναι όλα καλά εκεί κάτω στη γη των γουναρικών και των καπέλων fedoras;
cclu122	Όλα είναι εντάξει!
cclu123	Είναι όμορφο!
cclu124	Ανυπομονώ να έρθει κόσμος και να δοκιμάσει το νέο μου σύστημα!
cclu125	Είναι πολυυυυύ τζάμι!
cclu126	Θέλεις να σου πω γι'αυτό;
ccma127	Ok, Πες μου όλες τις λεπτομέρειες για το νέο σου σύστημα ελέγχου παλτών.
cclu128	Ναιιιί!
cclu129	Ok, βρήκα στο πίσω μέρος όλα αυτά τα πλαστικά πλακίδια, παρατημένα από το automat, και μάντεψε;
cclu130	ΕΧΟΥΝ ΟΛΑ ΑΡΙΘΜΟΥΣ ΕΠΑΝΩ ΤΟΥΣ!
cclu131	Έτσι αυτό που κάνω είναι να δίνω από ένα σε όλους όσους φέρνουν τα παλτά τους και...
cclu132	MANNY!
cclu133	ΔΕΝ ΜΕ ΠΑΡΑΚΟΛΟΥΘΕΙΣ ΚΑΝ!!!
cclu134	ΜΠΑΙΝΩ ΣΕ ΟΛΟ ΑΥΤΟ ΤΟΝ ΚΟΠΟ ΝΑ ΟΡΓΑΝΩΝΩ ΤΑ ΠΑΛΤΑ ΣΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΟΥΤΕ ΠΟΥ ΣΕ ΕΝΔΙΑΦΕΡΕΙ!
ccma135	Lupe...
cclu136	Ξέχνα το!
cclu137	Μην προσποιείσαι ότι σε ενδιαφέρει.
ccma138	Όχι, θέλω να ακούσω...
cclu139	HUP!
cclu140	Όχι, θα τα πω σε κανέναν άλλον.
cclu141	Κάποιον που να τον ενδιαφέρει.
ccma142	ΣΕ ΠΑΡΑΚΑΛΩ Πες μου τα πάντα για το καινούργιο σου σύστημα ελέγχου παλτών, αλήθεια.
cclu143	Μη με δουλεύεις, Cal.
ccma144	Ok, πίσω στη δουλειά.

cigl013	Ναι, ...Νομίζω πως το ξέρω αυτό!
cigl014	Αν θυμάμαι σωστά...
cigl015	Πάει κάπως...
cigl016	...έτσι:
cigl017	Ωω, το καράβι μου έχει μια σκουριασμένη άγκυρα.
cigl018	Πιο σκουριασμένη δεν γίνεται.
cigl019	Σε κάθε λιμάνι που πάω, τη ρίχνω,
cigl020	Αλλά πάντα γυρίζει πίσω σε μένα!
cigl021	Ωω Σκουριασμένη ’γκυρα,
cigl022	Πας κάτω, κάτω, κάτω.
cigl023	Ωω Σκουριασμένη ’γκυρα,
cigl024	Μάλλον πρέπει να μείνω εδώ γύρω.
cigl025	Τώρα, λατρεύω αυτή τη σκουριασμένη άγκυρα.
cigl026	Αλλά φίλε μου, αυτή δε με αγαπά.
cigl027	Και αυτό το πρωί ξύπνησα και μας βρήκα και τους δύο
cigl028	να περιφερόμαστε στην ανοιχτή θάλασσα!
cigl029	Ωω Σκουριασμένη ’γκυρα,
cigl030	Πας κάτω, κάτω, κάτω.
cigl031	Ωω Σκουριασμένη ’γκυρα,
cigl032	Μάλλον πρέπει να μείνω εδώ γύρω.
cigl033	Και σε κάθε ευκαιρία, την ευχαριστώ
cigl034	Που ποτέ δε με άφησε.
cigl035	Τα κόκαλά μου είναι χαραγμένα ξύλα, παρασυρμένα από τα νερά.
cigl036	Αλλά ποτέ δεν θα τα ελευθερώσει!

cigl067	Manny, ο αρχηγός της αστυνομίας μπήκε μέσα, και προσπάθησα να παίξω ένα τραγούδι γι'αυτόν...

cima069	Ωω, μη σε νοιάζει, Mano.
cima070	Απλά είναι εκνευρισμένος επειδή έχασε στο τάβλι.
cigl071	Μα, δεν υποτίθεται ότι πρέπει να κερδίζει πάντα για να συνεχίσει να μας συμπαθεί και να μην μας επιτίθεται ποτέ;

cnma195	Ευχαριστώ. Ποτέ δεν ξέρεις πότε μπορεί να φανεί χρήσιμο.
cncc196	Εϊ, δώσ'το μου πίσω, Manny!
cnma197	Ίσως όταν τακτοποιήσεις αυτά που χρωστάς στο μπαρ, ε, Charlie;
cncc198	Ωω, Manny...
cnma199	Τι άλλο μπορείς να πλαστογραφήσεις;

cncc205	Είμαστε όλοι πολίτες του ίδιου έθνους, και ο βασιλιάς μας ιππεύει ένα χλωμό άλογο.
cnma206	Οπότε, όχι διαβατήρια.
cncc207	Όχιιιι.  Όχι, αυτό το μικρό ολόγραμμα είναι τόσο δύσκολο, ξέρεις;
cnma208	Τι λες για διπλώματα οδήγησης;

cnma211	Μπορείς να φτιάξεις κάρτες μέλους Ένωσης της προκοπής;

cncc217	Αν μπορέσεις να πάρεις τα λεφτά μου από τον Maximino, θα σε κάνω ΠΡΟΕΔΡΟ αυτού του κλεφτο-σωματείου.
cnma218	Δε μου χρειάζεται να γίνω πρόεδρος, και γιατί ο Max έχει τα λεφτά σου;
cncc219	Έβαλα μια ολόκληρη βαλίτσα με χρήματα υποθήκη για ένα αρκετά μεγάλο στοίχημα τον προηγούμενο μήνα.
cncc220	Η κούρσα ήταν στημένη, Manny--μου έκλεψαν τα λεφτά μου σαν κοινοί κλέφτες.
cncc221	Έλα, πάρε αυτή την V.I.P. άδεια εισόδου και χρησιμοποίησε την για να μπεις στη Λέσχη του Ριψοκίνδυνου Χαρτοπαίκτη--
cncc222	...δε με αφήνουν να μπω εκεί μέσα πια...
cncc223	Πρέπει να υπάρχει ένα χρηματοκιβώτιο, κάπου μέσα στο κελάρι, και η βαλίτσα μου θα πρέπει να είναι μέσα.
cnma224	Και μπορείς να μου βρεις κάρτα απόψε;
cncc225	Αν τα καταφέρεις, Manny, η κάρτα θα βρίσκεται στο τραπέζι.
cnma226	Όταν σκεφτώ κάτι που χρειάζομαι, θα επιστρέψω.
cncc227	Δεν είμαι πηγάδι ευχών, Manny.
cnma228	Γιατί δεν βρίσκεσαι στα τραπέζια με τις ρουλέτες;
cncc229	Αα, η ρουλέτα είναι για μοναχικές χήρες και Γάλλους.
cncc230	Γιατί δεν παίρνεις μερικούς κουλοχέρηδες, Manny;
cncc231	Όλοι--γριές γυναίκες, μικρά παιδιά--όλοι λατρεύουν τους κουλοχέρηδες!
cncc232	Και έχω ένα σύστημα, ένα αλάνθαστο σύστημα, για να τους κερδίζω!
cnma233	Θα το σκεφτώ.
cncc234	Χμ-χα, χα, χα. Μπορώ να καταλάβω πότε μου κάνεις πλάκα, ξέρεις;
cnma235	Νομίζω οι κουλοχέρηδες τραβάνε έναν ανεπιθύμητο παράγοντα.
cncc236	Εε, είμαστε όλοι ανεπιθύμητοι, Manny...
cnma237	Ναι, αλλά τα λεφτά σας δεν είναι αρκετά για κέρδος.
cnma238	Όλοι μου οι φίλοι είναι μοναχικές χήρες και Γάλλοι.
cncc239	Εκτός από μένα, Manny.
cncc240	Είμαι εδώ για να σε κρατήσω στα λογικά σου.
cnma241	Πες μου το σύστημά σου, Charlie.
cncc243	Δε μπορώ να σου πω όλα μου τα μυστικά, ε, μόνο αυτό:  Πρέπει να γίνεις ένα με τον κουλοχέρη Manny.
cncc244	Πρέπει...πρέπει να μπεις μέσα στο μηχάνημα, και... και να το κάνεις να ΘΕΛΕΙ να πληρώσει!
cnma245	Τώρα που το ξανασκέφτομαι, μείνε μακριά από τα τραπέζια της ρουλέτας.
cnma246	Έχω ένα club να διευθύνω, οπότε...
cncc247	Και να διαπράξεις και μια διάρρηξη, μην το ξεχνάς!
cncc248	Α ναι, σε παρακαλώ Manny, συνέχισε τη γεμάτη αίγλη ζωή σου.
cnma250	Ωραίο κοστούμι. Από που το έκλεψες;
cncc251	Manny, αν μάθεις να παίζεις με τις πιθανότητες όπως ο Chowchilla Charlie...

lmve106	Μη χαζολογάς!
lmma107	Σωστά!
lmma108	Ωωω, σε πιάνει φόβος εδώ κάτω.
lmtx109	velasco
lmma110	Αυτός ο Velasco είναι ένα θαλασσοδαρμένο παλιό τσουβάλι σχοινιά.
lmve111	Ου-χου-χου-χου, που να δεις τη γυναίκα του!
lmma112	Εϊ, ναύτη.
lmve113	Σταμάτα να χαζολογάς.
lmve114	Ναι ε, καλό και αυτό.
lmtx115	bottle
lmma116	Ωραίο το καραβάκι-στο-μπουκάλι που έχεις εκεί!
lmve117	Ναι, την άλλη εβδομάδα ξέρεις είναι το πανηγύρι σκαφών στη Rubacava, οπότε...
lmma160	Ότι ακριβώς χρειαζόταν το πανόραμα Lumbago--ψεύτικο ωκεανό!
lmma161	Θα νόμιζες ότι μετά από δύο χρόνια θα είχε τοποθετήσει τις μικρές σωστικές λέμβους του S.S. Lumbago, τουλάχιστον.
lmma118	Εϊ, για να το δω αυτό--
lmve119	Θα σου το σπάσω στο κεφάλι αν ξαναπροσπαθήσεις να το πάρεις!
lmma165	Έχω πολύ μεγαλύτερα προβλήματα να αντιμετωπίσω.
lmma162	Μάλλον θα το τελειώσω για αυτόν.
lmma163	Θα το πιω αλλά πιθανότατα το  S.S. Lumbago θα μου κάτσει στο λαιμό.
lmma120	Κάτσε, άσε με να σε βοηθήσω με αυτό--
lmve121	Αα!
lmve122	Υπάρχουν κάποια πράγματα που ένας άντρας πρέπει να τα κάνει μόνος του!
lmtx123	gate
lmve124	Το ξέρω-Εγώ την κλείδωσα!
lmtx125	limbo
lmma126	Το S.S. Limbo χρειάζεται λίγο φροντίδα.
lmma127	Ναι, ίσως ο Velasco δεν το προσέξει...
lmma128	Ποτέ δεν ήμουν καλός στο άλμα εις ύψος.
lmma129	Κούνα αυτά τα κοντά πόδια.

lmma134	As I stood there alone.(όπως στεκόμουν εκεί μοναχός)
lmve135	As I stood there alone.(όπως στεκόμουν εκεί μοναχός)
lmma136	And I thought to myself how the moon,(και αναρωτιόμουν, πως το φεγγάρι)
lmve137	And I thought to myself how the moon,(και αναρωτιόμουν, πως το φεγγάρι)
lmma138	That night, cast its light (εκείνη τη νύχτα, έριχνε το φως του)
lmve139	That night, cast its light (εκείνη τη νύχτα, έριχνε το φως του)
lmma140	On my heart's true delight,(στης καρδιάς μου την πραγματική ευχαρίστηση)
lmve141	On my heart's true delight,(στης καρδιάς μου την πραγματική ευχαρίστηση)
lmma142	And the reef where her body was strewn.(και στο σκόπελο όπου το σώμα της διασκορπίστηκε)
lmve143	And the reef where her body was strewn.(και στο σκόπελο όπου το σώμα της διασκορπίστηκε)
lmma164	Ααααα, δεν είναι το ίδιο χωρίς τον γέρο Velasco.
lmma144	Δεν έχω τέτοιου είδους εξοπλισμό.
lmtx145	gangplank
lmma001	Μπορείς να μου εξηγήσεις πάλι γιατί δεν μπορώ να επιβιβαστώ;
lmma002	Εντάξει, είμαι έτοιμος να σαλπάρω!
lmve003	Πάνω σε τι;
lmma004	Πάνω στο Limbo, δικέ μου, πάμε!
lmve005	Manny, Manny, Manny... Το Limbo's δεν είναι επιβατικό πλοίο!
lmve006	Το Limbo δεν είναι επιβατικό πλοίο;
lmve007	Είναι ένα μικρό εμπορικό πλοίο αγόρι μου, και όλοι πάνω στο πλοίο δουλεύουν!
lmma008	Θα δουλέψω!
lmve009	Τι ικανότητες έχεις;
lmma010	Πωλήσεις και διεύθυνση εστιατορίου.
lmve011	Ωωωω...εϊ, υπάρχει ΜΙΑ ανοιχτή θέση στο πλήρωμα του Limbo...
lmma012	Ναι;
lmve013	Ναι, είναι στο μηχανοστάσιο, και ο φιλαράκος σου ο Glottis είναι ο ιδανικός!
lmve014	Αλλά θα πρέπει να φέρει τα δικά του εργαλεία...
lmma015	Ok, αν βρω στον Glottis μερικά εργαλεία, μπορούμε να επιβιβαστούμε;
lmve016	Εε, ΕΚΕΙΝΟΣ μπορεί, ναι.
lmve017	Χωρίς παρεξήγηση Manny, αλλά απλά δεν υπάρχει χώρος για σένα πάνω στο Limbo.
lmve018	Είναι πλήρως επανδρωμένο ήδη.
lmve019	Για την ακρίβεια, όλο το πλήρωμά του είναι στο καράβι, έτοιμο να σαλπάρει την αυγή...
lmve020	...εκτός από έναν τύπο...
lmma021	Ποιος είναι αυτός που δεν επιβιβάστηκε ακόμη;
lmve022	Ο ναύτης Naranja έχει αργήσει λίγο, αλλά θα είναι εδώ πριν σαλπάρουμε.
lmma023	Τι δουλειά κάνει ο Naranja;
lmve024	Είχε την κουζίνα του πλοίου...
lmma025	Α χα! Διευθυντής εστιατορίου!
lmve026	Ναι, είναι παρόμοιο με αυτό που κάνεις εσύ τώρα, μόνο το ψάρι είναι πιο φρέσκο στο Limbo.
lmma027	Και αν ο Naranja δεν φανεί; Μπορώ να τον αντικαταστήσω, σωστά;
lmve028	Manny, δεν είσαι καν στο ναυτικό σωματείο!
lmma029	Εγώ το ξέρω, και εσύ το ξέρεις, αλλά είμαστε δύο άνθρωποι που κρατάνε μυστικά, σωστά;
lmve030	Glottis απαλλάσσεται, αλλά ο καπετάνιος θα ζητήσει τη ΔΙΚΗ ΣΟΥ κάρτα, και αν δεν έχεις...
lmve031	...Θα σε ταΐσουν στους καρχαρίες σαν δόλωμα, και το χειρότερο...
lmve032	Θα μου βάλουν πρόστιμο!
lmve033	Είναι αυστηρό σωματείο, και δεν τα βάζω μαζί τους!
lmma034	Λοιπόν για να καταλάβω...
lmma035	Αν βρω στον Glottis μερικά εργαλεία...
lmve036	Τότε μπορώ να του βρω μια δουλειά πάνω στο Limbo.
lmma037	...και αν ο ναύτης Naranja δεν εμφανιστεί για δουλειά...
lmve038	Που θα έρθει.
lmma039	...και πάρω κάρτα του ναυτικού σωματείου...
lmve040	...που ποτέ δεν θα πάρεις.
lmma041	Τότε μπορώ να σαλπάρω με το Limbo το πρωί;
lmve042	Τςςς.
lmve043	ΥΠΟΘΕΤΩ.
lmma044	Τι είδους εργαλεία θα χρειαστεί ο Glottis;
lmve045	Αυθεντικό εξοπλισμό Θαλάσσιας Μέλισσας μόνο.
lmma046	Που μπορώ να βρω αυθεντικό Θαλάσσιας Μέλισσας εξοπλισμό;
lmve047	Γιατί δεν ρωτάς μια Θαλάσσια Μέλισσα;
lmve048	Φοβάσαι μην τσιμπηθείς;
lmve049	ΧΑ ΧΑ ΧΑ, ΧΑ-ΧΑ!!!
lmma050	Ήρθε ο Naranja;
lmve051	Όχι αλλά τηλεφώνησε ο Toto Santos, είπε ότι λιποθύμησε στο σπίτι του.
lmma052	Οπότε δεν είναι σε θέση να ταξιδέψει, σωστά;
lmve053	Manny, λιποθύμησε, αλλά δεν ξεράθηκε κιόλας.
lmve054	Εε, όχι. Αλλά το παιδί δεν έχει χάσει ποτέ το πλοίο ακόμα!
lmma055	Που νομίζεις ότι βρίσκεται ο Naranja;
lmve056	Μάλλον είναι σπίτι του και διαλέγει συνταγές για το ταξίδι!
lmma057	Πως μπορώ να γίνω μέλος του σωματείου, γρήγορα;
lmve058	Manny, παίρνει μήνες για να μπεις στο σωματείο...
lmve059	...το ελάχιστο, αν το κάνεις νόμιμα.
lmve060	Μα.. ωχ-ωχ, Θα σου πω κάτι...Δεν με ενδιαφέρει αν η κάρτα σου δεν αξίζει 100%...
lmve061	Αρκεί να δείχνει σωστή, με κατάλαβες;
lmma062	Νομίζω.
lmma063	Λοιπόν, που μπορώ να βρω μια πλαστή κάρτα του σωματείου;
lmve064	Πιο σιγά τη φωνή σου αγόρι μου!
lmma065	Μα, είπες...
lmve066	Ποτέ δεν είπα τέτοιο πράγμα!
lmve067	Υπάρχουν υπάνθρωποι που κρύβονται στις σκοτεινές γωνιές αυτής της πόλης που θα έδιναν σε κάποιον σχεδόν οτιδήποτε θελήσει...
lmve068	Μα δεν γνωρίζω κανέναν τους!
lmma069	Τι γίνεται μέσα σε αυτό το μπουκάλι; Ένα καράβι ρυμουλκό;
lmve070	Αυτό τυγχάνει να είναι ένα τέλειο αντίγραφο του SS Lumbago!
lmve071	Απλά έχω ένα μικρό πρόβλημα να κάνω τη δοκό επιβίβασης να χωρέσει στον αυχένα, εδώ...
lmma072	Χμ-αυτό είναι αστείο γιατί το lumbago είναι συνήθως ένα πρόβλημα στην κατώτερη πλάτη παρά στον αυχένα...
lmve073	Εε-χμμμμ;
lmma074	Τίποτα.
lmma075	Καλύτερα να πάω να τελειώσω το πακετάρισμα.
lmve076	Ναι, εντάξει, παλικάρι μου.

bima398	Ο Hector LeMans προσπάθησε αλλά αστόχησε, τώρα είναι η σειρά μου.
bima399	Κατευθύνομαι στο El Marrow για να τον βγάλω εκτός κυκλοφορίας.
biol400	Manny, εκείνο το μέρος έχει αλλάξει--δεν ξέρεις που πας να μπλέξεις!
biol401	Καλύτερα να έρθω μαζί σου.
biol402	Μόνο ένα λεπτό να ετοιμαστώ.
bima403	Ok, αλλά αν ακούσεις μια δυνατή έκρηξη σύντομα, το ταξίδι ακυρώνεται.
bima001	Λοιπόν, πως σου φάνηκε το ποίημα;
bisl002	Μου άρεσε.
bisl003	Ήταν λυπηρό και όμορφο, σαν την μητέρα μου.
bial004	Το περιφρόνησα.
bial005	Ήταν πολύ μικρό και δεν μου έλεγε τίποτα...
bial006	...σαν τον πατέρα μου.
bigu007	Δεν είχα κανένα συναίσθημα για αυτό.
bigu008	Ήταν ακατάδεκτο και γλειφόταν πολύ...

biol012	Συνήθως δεν κάνω τα παλιά, αλλά αυτό θα το κάνω, μόνο για σένα.
biol013	Πάλι; Manny, οι σταθεροί πελάτες μου βαριούνται!

bima023	Δεν είμαι σίγουρος ότι ξέρω τι σημαίνει.
biol024	Ευχαριστώ
bisl025	Αλλά δεν βλέπεις;
bisl026	Όταν η κυβέρνηση φεύγει, το ίδιο κάνουν και οι μπελάδες.
bigu027	Α, χαζομάρες. Πάντα θα χρειαζόμαστε μια οπλισμένη δύναμη να μάχεται την επιστροφή του καπιταλισμού!
bial028	Αυτού του είδους ο φασιστικός τρόπος σκέψης είναι τόσο νεκρός όσο και εσύ, σύντροφε.
bial029	Όταν ξεφορτωθούμε όλα τα όπλα, τότε είναι που οι άνθρωποι θα αρχίσουν να αυτο-αστυνομεύονται, και η κοινή γνώμη και μόνο θα τους αποτρέπει από το να διαπράττουν εγκλήματα!
bima030	Hola, διαχειριστές κεφαλαίων!
bisl031	Εϊ, κοίτα ποιος κάνει σκηνή!
bisl032	Είναι ο Manny Calavera, η καρδιά του Nouveau Riche.
bial033	Δίνε του, ρόμπα.
bial034	Μιλάμε για πράγματα που δεν θα καταλάβεις, όπως η αλήθεια και η ομορφιά!
bima035	Buenas noches, σύντροφοι.
bigu036	Εϊ, Manny, χωρίς παρεξήγηση, αλλά δεν έχουμε χρόνο για αναγνωρίσιμους τύπος σαν εσένα.
bima037	Τι σας κάνει ρε παιδιά να νομίζεται ότι είμαι τόσο αναγνωρίσιμος;
bisl038	Βρωμάς μπέικον και καταπίεση δικέ μου!

bima040	Εϊ, παιδιά!
bigu041	Συγγνώμη, Manny.
bigu042	Δεν υπάρχει χώρος για μπουρζουάδες στην επανάστασή μας.
bisl043	Ναι δικέ μου. Καθόλου χώρος για τη χοντρή γάτα από το πάρτυ που δεν έστειλε προσκλήσεις στην εργατική τάξη.
bima044	Hola!
bisl045	Και τι με αυτό, Κύριε Ρουλέτα, Κύριε Γκρουπιέρη, Κύριε Μ'αρέσουν-Τα-Μήλα-Αλλά-Μισώ-Τους-Ξεφλουδιστές;
bisl046	Πάρε μια ανάσα από τα προνόμιά σου, τις μεγάλες φαμφάρες του τίτλου σου...
bisl047	Θα ξερνούσα, αλλά δεν έχω φαί στην κοιλιά μου γιατί δεν παίζω το παιχνίδι του!
bisl048	’κουσα ότι ο ιδιοκτήτης του station wagon, ο ιδιοκτήτης του μακαρονοποιητή...
bisl049	Το τρύπιο κουφάρι ενός γάτου που θυμάται να κουμπώσει το κολάρο του, αλλά ξεχνάει τον αδελφό του που είναι στο δρόμο.
bisl050	’λλη μια επίσκεψη από το φάντασμα του καπιταλισμού, κουδουνίζοντας τις αλυσίδες που τον κρατάνε δέσμιο, τον ομφάλιο λώρο του στο πανίσχυρο δολλάριο...
bisl051	Βάλε το "Man"(άντρας) στον Manny, και από εδώ και πέρα θα έχεις ψυχρή αντιμετώπιση.
bisl052	Ωω, χάσου.
bima053	Εϊ, σας έχω πει ποτέ παιδιά ότι μου θυμίζετε το φίλο μου...
bima054	...SALVADOR LIMONES;
bisl055	Ο Salvador Limones είναι παραμύθι, μια τρομακτική ιστορία που Αυτός λέει στον κόσμο για να τον κοιμίζει...
bial056	Βλάκα!
bial057	Ο Salvador Limones είναι αληθινός, και πολύ σπουδαίος, σπουδαίος άνδρας.
bima058	Επίσης γράφει και περίεργα γράμματα.
bial059	Τι είναι αυτό;
bial060	"Εγώ ο Salvador Limones... Σας χαιρετίζω; Manuel Calavera;"
bigu061	"Ένας σπουδαίος σύμμαχος σε αυτήν την ευγενή επανάσταση;"
bial062	Πραγματικά γνωρίζεις τον Salvador Limones;
bial063	Πως είναι;
bigu064	Γιατί δεν μας είπες ότι είσαι μαχητής της ελευθερίας, Manuel;
bima065	Δεν μπορώ να μιλάω για την μυστική μου δραστηριότητα, αλλιώς θα τους βάλω όλους σε κίνδυνο.
bial066	Ουάου.
bisl067	Βαρύ.
bima068	Εϊ, Αα-Πρέπει να του δίνω, οπότε χμμ...
bima069	(Viva la Revolucion!)
bial070	Ωω, δικέ μου!
bima071	Τρελός.

bima073	"Κεφάλαιο Πρώτο:"
bima074	"Οι εργάτες θα ελέγχουν τα μέσα παραγωγής..."
bima075	Ωουυ, καλύτερα να μην το δείξω αυτό στον Glottis.
bima076	Μοιάζει πολύ στεγνό. Θα το φυλάξω για το βράδυ πριν πέσω για ύπνο.
bima077	Σας πειράζει "γάτες" αν ρίξω μια ματιά σε αυτό το βιβλίο για λίγο;
bigu078	Κάνε τη δουλειά σου αδερφέ μου.
bima079	Εϊ, μπορώ να δανειστώ αυτό το βιβλίο;
bial080	Γιατί; Για να φρικάρεις με τα σχέδιά μας για οργάνωση της δουλειάς και να πας να μας καρφώσεις στο φιλαράκο σου, τον Αρχηγό Bogen;
bima081	Εϊ, απλά ψάχνω κάτι να διαβάσω στην τουαλέτα, εντάξει;
bial082	Δεν το ρισκάρω.
bima083	Φαίνεται ότι είναι βραδιά "ανοιχτού μικροφώνου".
bima404	Απλά δεν μπορώ να το κάνω χωρίς κοινό.
biol405	Θα το κάνω;
bima406	Olivia!
bima084	Εϊ, κοίτα!
bima085	Ψόφιοι κοριοί!
bima086	Κι άλλες "γάτες"...
bima087	Δεν είναι τέτοιου είδους bar.
bima088	Γεια, πως σε λένε;
bima407	Μια από αυτές τις μέρες, θα μπω εκεί μέσα.
bima089	Αα, η φωλιά της αγάπης.
biol408	Έφτασε η ώρα να φύγουμε;
bima409	Όχι, έχουμε ένα προβληματάκι με το αυτοκίνητο--
biol410	Πέρασε όταν έρθει η ώρα!
bima090	Σε πειράζει αν μπω μέσα;
biol091	Δεν θέλεις να μπεις εκεί μέσα.
biol092	Δεν έχω καθαρίσει ακόμα.
bima093	"Blue Casket (Μπλε Φέρετρο)"
bima094	Μακάρι να είχα ονομάσει το club μου ΕΤΣΙ!
bima095	Αλλά όχι, έπρεπε να χρησιμοποιήσω το δικό μου όνομα, σαν βλάκας.
bima096	Αυτό θα προκαλούσε πολλές σπίθες, σπασμένα γυαλιά και νευριασμένους επαναστάτες.
bima097	Αφού δεν ανακατεύομαι με τα πράγματα της Olivia, δεν ανακατεύεται και αυτή με τα δικά μου. Αυτή είναι η συμφωνία.
bima098	Είναι η Olivia Ofrenda.
bima099	Όχι το κορίτσι του Max. Αποκλείεται.
biol100	Τι είναι αυτά; Ποιος είναι ο Salvador Limones;
bima101	Olivia, τι είδους επαναστάτρια είσαι;
biol102	Ποιος είπε ότι είμαι επαναστάτρια;
biol103	Θα πρέπει να μελετήσω, μπορεί να ενθουσιάσει τους πελάτες...
bima104	Ωωωωχ, μυρίζει λες και η πόρτα οδηγεί στην κουζίνα.
bima105	Αυτή είναι η έξοδος.
biol220	Πες μου Manny...
biol221	Τι ΚΑΝΟΥΝ οι μεγαλοαστοί;
bima222	Καλά, πως είναι ο Max;
biol223	Ωω, Παππού, μην αρχίζεις.
bima224	Τι κάνεις με ένα φίδι σαν τον Nick;
biol225	Θα σου εξηγήσω, Manny, αλλά εε, δε νομίζω ότι θα καταλάβεις.
bima226	Το να χαζολογάς με το δικηγόρο του φίλου σου είναι αρκετά επικίνδυνο.
biol227	Ω, ίσως έκανα λάθος...
biol228	Καταλαβαίνεις!
bima229	Ανησυχώ λίγο για τη Lola...
biol230	Είναι καταδικασμένη, Manny.
biol231	Ερωτεύθηκε τον Maximino!
biol232	Αυτό είναι ένα λάθος που ποτέ δεν έκανα.
bima233	Πιστεύεις ότι ο Nick θα της έκανε κακό;
biol234	Μόνο άμα την βρει, και άκου με που σου λέω--δεν είναι καλός στο να βρίσκει πράγματα.
bima235	Η βραδιά ανοιχτού μικροφώνου φαίνεται ότι έχει μεγάλη επιτυχία.
biol236	Πάντα παίρνει λίγο χρόνο σε αυτές τις φοβητσιάρικές ψυχές για να ξεσηκωθούν.
bima237	Ίσως θα βοηθούσε αν ανέβαινες εσύ επάνω για να πάρει τα πάνω του;
biol238	Ωω, Manny.
biol239	Να διαβάσω ποίηση στο ίδιο μου το club;
biol240	Θα φαινόταν λες και όλο αυτό το μέρος ήταν ένας μεγάλος ναός λατρείας για μένα.
bima241	Ωω, έλα τώρα. Μόνο ένα ποίημα. Σαν παράδειγμα για τα ντροπαλά παιδιά.
bima242	Ωω, έλα--
bima243	Εϊ, τι θα έλεγες για ακόμα ένα ποίημα;
biol244	Είμαι στεγνή ως το κόκαλο, στέρεψα από ποιήματα!
bima245	Απλά ξεκίνα πάλι από την κορυφή, κάθε φορά γίνονται και καλύτερα.
biol246	Αλήθεια;
bima247	Είναι λίγο σκοτεινά εδώ μέσα, δε νομίζεις;
biol248	Σκοτεινά και κρύα, σαν τις καρδιές των αντρών.
bima249	Ουχ...
bima250	Ξέρεις, σκέφτομαι να αγοράσω αυτό το μέρος.
biol251	Αλήθεια, εγώ σκέφτηκα κάποια στιγμή να αγοράσω το δικό σου.
biol252	Αλλά, μετά απλά αποφάσισα να ζητήσω στο αγόρι μου τον Max να μου το αγοράσει.
bima253	Μπορείς να το πάρεις. Φεύγω από την πόλη.
biol254	Manny!
biol255	Ακούγεσαι τόσο ενθουσιώδης ξαφνικά!
biol256	Γιατί φεύγεις από την πόλη;
bima257	Johnny Law, μωρό μου. Βλέπεις, είμαι κλεφτρόνι. Είμαι κακά νέα.
biol258	Ναι καλά...
biol259	Τρέχεις πίσω από αυτή τη γκόμενα φάντασμα, όλοι λένε ότι είσαι ακόμη τόσο νευρικός μαζί της.
bima260	Κυνηγώ μια γυναίκα που γνώρισα μια φορά και δεν μπορώ να ξεχάσω.
biol261	Έχω ένα ποίημα που έγραψα μόνο για σένα.
biol262	Δώσε βάση γιατί είναι πολύ μικρό. Πάμε...
biol263	Chuuuuuuuummmmmmmm-P!
bima264	Θα σε δω μετά, κοριτσάκι.
biol265	Συνέχισε την εξάσκηση, δικέ μου, θα το πιάσεις!
biol266	Ok!
biol267	Ζωντανοί!
biol268	Κοιμηθήκαμε!
biol269	Η ζωή είναι μόνο ένα ανοιγόκλειμα του ματιού
biol270	Σε ένα ζεστό, άνετο κρεβάτι...
biol271	Θαμμένοι!
biol272	Ξυπνάμε!
biol273	Το όνειρο της σάρκας τελείωσε, Μπαμπά!
biol274	Τώρα που είμαστε όλοι τρελοί νεκροί!
biol275	Στάχτες σε στάχτες
biol276	...σε στάχτες
biol277	σε στάχτες...
biol278	...σε στάχτες
biol279	σε στάχτες...
biol280	...σε στάχτες
biol281	σε στάχτες...
biol282	σε ΜΕΝΑ...
biol283	...σε στάχτες
biol284	σε στάχτες...
biol285	...σε στάχτες
biol286	σε στάχτες...
biol287	Ονόμασα τη γάτα μου "Boney."
biol288	'Μέχρι που μου είπε ότι δεν της κάνει.
biol289	Είπα, "Γιατί;"
biol290	Και αυτή μου είπε, "Αδελφή,
biol291	'Γιατί έτσι φωνάζω ΕΓΩ ΕΣΕΝΑ!"
biol292	Ok, ένα τελευταίο φίλοι μου.

sima159	Έχουν ταμπέλες, "Ναυτικά" και "Ωραία..."
sima160	Και το τρίτο λέει απλά, "Αγκυρομανία!"
sito161	ΑΧ ΑΧ ΑΧ! Φύγε από εκεί!

sima163	Δυνατό πράμα. Αυτό θα έπρεπε να σκοτώνει τον πόνο.
sina164	Θα έπρεπε, αλλά δεν το κάνει.
sito165	Εγώ σκοτώνω τον πόνο. Κλείνω το τρυπάνι μου, σταματάω να δουλεύω. Τι θα'λεγες γι'αυτό;
sina166	Όχι, όχι, όχι! Θα αντέξω!
sina167	Έλα λοιπόν!
sito168	Θα σε κάνω να 'πεταχτείς', ναυτάκι...
sima169	Θα το πρόσεχε αν το έπαιρνα, και είναι πιο μεγαλόσωμος από μένα.
sina170	Ουπς--Το χρειάζομαι αυτό!
sito171	Πρέπει να μείνεις ακίνητος, ή θα χρειαστεί να σε δέσω κάτω!
sima172	Μπαα, θα με έβλεπε να το κάνω!
sima173	Θα μπορούσα να ρουφήξω λίγο ποτό, αλλά το σιφόνι δε χωρά μέσα από το λαιμό του μπουκαλιού.
sima174	Τέλος πάντων. Έχω πολύ μπόμπα(ποτό) στο σπίτι μου.
sima175	Υπάρχει πιο δυνατό πράμα από αυτό εκεί μέσα ήδη.

sima177	Φαίνεται να πονάει.
sima178	Ωω, όχι. Τέλος το ψάρεμα ναυτών για μένα!

sina180	Όχι, όχι, αλλά το ποτό είναι, λίγο.

mgma043	Χμμμμ...
mgma044	Αργά τη νύχτα και ακόμα στο νεκροτομείο, έτσι δεν είναι Membrillo;
mgme045	Ξέρεις ότι δεν μπορώ να κοιμηθώ όταν υπάρχει κάποιος αγνώστων στοιχείων εδώ, Manny.
mgme046	Αν δεν αναγνωρίσω αυτούς τους κήπους με τα τριαντάφυλλα απόψε, δεν θα είμαι έτοιμος για τους δύο που έρχονται αύριο, και πριν το καταλάβεις...
mgme047	...Είμαι μέχρι το λαιμό μέσα στις αζαλέες.

mgma049	Κανένα στοιχείο;
mgme050	Το ξέρω ότι είναι ένας κακομοίρης ιατροδικαστής που του φταίνε τα εργαλεία του, Manny...
mgme051	...αλλά πως να βρω οτιδήποτε με τον εξοπλισμό που μου έδωσαν;
mgma052	Εϊ, είχα μια κυβερνητική εργασία για χρόνια, φίλε μου.
mgma053	Ξέρω πως νιώθεις.
mgma054	Δεν θα μου άρεσε να τελειώσει έτσι.
mgme055	Τότε άκου τη συμβουλή μου--αγόρασε ένα μπρασελέ ταυτότητα και φόρα το, πάντα.
mgma056	Δεν θα ταίριαζε με τα μανικετόκουμπά μου.
mgma057	Δε νομίζω ότι το να μαζεύεις λουλούδια είναι πρέπων αυτή τη στιγμή.
mgma058	Το σκάψιμο σε παρτέρια μα λουλούδια είναι δουλειά του Membrillo, όχι δική μου.
mgma059	Είσαι σίγουρος ότι ψάχνεις αρκετά σκληρά;
mgme060	Κοίτα, Manuel, αυτά τα γέρικα μάτια είναι κουρασμένα...
mgme061	Κάνω ότι καλύτερο μπορώ, αλλά ένας ρακοσυλλέκτης παραλίας στη μέση ηλικία συνταξιοδότησης, έχει πιο εξελιγμένο εξοπλισμό από αυτόν που έχω εγώ εδώ!

mgma064	Νομίζω ότι ο Membrillo θα χρειαζόταν πραγματικά διακοπές σε κάποιο τροπικό μέρος.
mgma065	Θα βοηθούσε ένας ανιχνευτής μετάλλου το σκοπό;
mgme066	Εϊ, όπως στα κεντρικά!
mgme067	Ποτέ δεν ξέρεις που θα καταλήξει αυτό!
mgme068	Ένα χαραγμένο δαχτυλίδι... μια αγκράφα ζώνης με το όνομα κάποιου πάνω...

mgma001	Τι θλιβερή ιστορία, αυτοί οι δύο άνθισαν και κανείς δεν ήρθε να τα ζητήσει...
mgme003	Ο θάνατος βγάζει θλιβερές ιστορίες από όλους μας.
mgma004	Πως πάνε οι δουλειές;
mgme005	Αυξάνονται, δυστυχώς.
mgme006	Περισσότερο έγκλημα κάθε μέρα, και όλο και περισσότεροι οι ανθισμένοι σαν και αυτούς.
mgme007	Κάτι συμβαίνει πίσω στο El Marrow, νομίζω, και το μαύρο χέρι του μας φτάνει τελικά εδώ στη Rubacava.
mgma008	Τι ακριβώς ψάχνεις;
mgme009	Ψάχνω για έναν θησαυρό που μέρος μου δεν εύχεται να βρω...
mgme010	Γιατί όταν ξεθάψω αυτό το δουβλόνι που θα μου φανερώσει ποιος είναι αυτή η φτωχή ψυχή...
mgme011	...η ανταμοιβή μου δεν είναι τα πλούτη, αλλά η ευκαιρία να κάνω ένα τηλεφώνημα, και να ραγίσω την καρδιά κάποιου.
mgme012	Ευχαριστώ για τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλου, παρεπιπτώντως.
mgme013	Βεβαία, με αυτόν τον εξοπλισμό, η έρευνα μπορεί να πάρει κάμποσο χρόνο.
mgma014	Μπορώ να βοηθήσω;
mgme015	Βέβαια, κράτα σφιχτά αυτό το φύλλο εδώ...
mgme016	...Manny;
mgma017	Δε μπορώ να το κάνω.
mgme018	Το ξέρω, απλά σε δοκίμαζα.
mgma019	Πως κάνεις αυτή τη δουλειά;
mgme020	Χωρίς να κουράζομαι, εννοείς;
mgme021	Το μυστικό μου για την ευτυχία, Manuel, είναι ότι έχω την καρδιά ενός δωδεκάχρονου αγοριού.
mgme022	Την έχω εκεί μέσα στο βάζο. Θέλεις να τη δεις;
mgma023	ΟΧΙ!
mgme024	Συγγνώμη. Παλιό αστείο ιατροδικαστών.
mgma025	Φοβάσαι ποτέ ότι η δουλειά σου σε επηρεάζει, Membrillo;
mgme026	Κοίτα, η ιατροδικαστική βοτανική είναι μια κοπιαστική δουλειά, Manny, αλλά έχεις μείνει ποτέ για πολύ χρόνο εδώ μαζί με έναν ανθοκόμο;
mgme027	Στη ζωή, γίνονταν ανθοκόμοι γιατί αγαπούσαν τα λουλούδια, αλλά εδώ...
mgme028	...το λουλούδι είναι σύμβολο του πόνου, του θανάτου μέσα στο θάνατο.
mgme029	Τα αντικρουόμενα συναισθήματά τους συσσωρεύονται και συσσωρεύονται, και τελικά τρελαίνονται.
mgma030	Ευχαριστώ για την πληροφορία.
mgma031	Από εδώ και πέρα θα στέλνω μπουκέτα με μπαλόνια.
mgma032	Membrillo, γιατί μένεις στην πόλη;
mgma033	Γιατί δεν πας προς τον Ένατο ’δη;
mgme034	Manny, μπορείς να ψάχνεις για κάτι ορισμένα χρόνια...
mgme035	...προτού πάψεις να πιστεύεις σε αυτό ολοκληρωτικά.
mgma036	Δεν πιστεύεις στον Ένατο ’δη;
mgme037	Γιατί νομίζεις είμαστε όλοι εδώ στη Rubacava;
mgma038	Γιατί περιμένεις να εκτίσεις το χρόνο σου, ή γιατί δεν έχεις χρήματα για να περάσεις, ή...
mgme039	Manny, έχουμε εγκαταλείψει. Όλοι μας.
mgme040	Όταν θα έχεις μείνει εδώ αρκετά, το ίδιο θα κάνεις και εσύ.
mgma041	Να μην σε ενοχλώ...
mgme042	Πάντα είναι ωραία να έχω επισκέπτες.

slca181	Ακόμα μία παράλογη τρομοκρατική πράξη, εξουδετερώθηκε από την Αξιωματικό Ασφαλείας Carla.
slca182	Ουάου. Καταστράφηκε τελείως από τους πυροδοτητές μας, οπότε δεν μπορώ να καταλάβω τι είδους βόμβα ήταν.
slca183	Αλλά εδώ υπάρχει κάτι...
slma184	Ένα κλειδί. Καλύτερα να το πάω στον Αρχηγό Bogen.
slca185	Ναι, μπορείς να το αναλύσεις με τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλου σου.
slca186	Ναι, είναι πιθανότατα το κλειδί για κανένα κρησφύγετο τρομοκρατών!
slca187	Αααα! Λατρεύω αυτό το σημείο!
slca188	Κύριε, αν θα θέλατε, παρακαλώ, τοποθετήστε όλα σας τα πράγματα στο γραφείο ασφαλείας...
slca189	...και μετά πήδα έξω από το κωλοπαράθυρο!
slma190	Ωω, Carla...
slca191	Είσαι σίγουρος ότι δεν έχεις πάνω σου τίποτε άλλο;
slma192	Τίποτα που να πυροδοτήσει αυτό το πράγμα.
slca193	Τότε, κύριε, φοβάμαι ότι θα πρέπει να έρθετε μαζί μου στο πίσω μέρος.
slma194	Οι κανόνες είναι κανόνες.
slma195	(μπούρπ)
slca196	Αα, είσαι καθαρός.
slca197	Να πάρει, Manny! Σχεδόν έπρεπε να σε γδύσω και να σε ψάξω!
slca256	(Μπούυρπ!)
slca198	Ουάου, Manny Calavera.  Ποτέ δεν έρχεσαι εδώ πάνω να με δεις πια.
slma199	Εε, σκέφτηκα ότι θα χρειαζόσουν λίγη συντροφιά, με όλους να έχουν φύγει για τη Μέρα των Νεκρών.
slca200	Αφού είναι έτσι, Manny, γιατί δεν κάθεσαι μέχρι στις έξι;
slca201	Τότε φεύγω.

slma218	Ίσως απλά μου αρέσουν οι βόλτες με το αερόπλοιο.

slca236	Αυτή η πόλη αλλάζει, Manny. Γίνεται πιο σκληρή κάθε μέρα.

slca002	Τι;
slma003	Τσιγάρα, για τι μοιάζει;
slca004	Δεν μπορείς να καπνίσεις στη δουλειά, Manny.
slca005	Μην προσπαθείς να τα συμμαζέψεις, Manny, είναι πολύ αργά.
slma006	Είναι ένα καινούργιο σύνθετο για το makeup σου.
slca007	Manny, δεν φοράω make-up, και το ξέρεις.
slma008	Και δεν εννοώ ότι χρειάζεσαι να φορέσεις.
slca009	Ωραία.
slma010	Είναι κάτι σπέσιαλ που σου αγόρασα.
slca011	Είναι τόσο γλυκό, Manny!
slca012	Αλλά φύλαξέ το για αργότερα, ok;
slca013	Όταν θα τελειώσω τη βάρδια μου;
slma014	Δεν ξέρω. Το βρήκα κάτω από το γραφείο σου.
slca015	Αφύλακτο;
slma016	Ναι
slca017	Ωω Θεέ μου!
slca018	Δώσ'το μου!
slca019	Είναι βόμβα!
slma020	Όχι, ήταν ένας ύπουλος τύπος με τρελά μάτια που την έβαλε εκεί.
slma139	Πολύ εντυπωσιακή μέρα, εε;
slca140	Ακόμα βουίζουν τα αυτιά μου από την έκρηξη!
slma141	Πολλή δουλειά απόψε;
slca142	Μπαααα.
slca143	Όλοι έχουν πάει στα σπίτια τους ήδη για τις γιορτές.
slca144	Αυτό το μέρος είναι νέκρα και βαριέμαι, Manny, βαριέμαι!
slma145	Τι περιμένει αυτό το όχημα;
slca146	Αα, απλά το καθαρίζουν, αλλά είναι πολύ σχολαστικοί.
slca147	Έχουμε στενό πρόγραμμά εδώ, ξέρεις.
slma148	Μπορώ να δοκιμάσω τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλου σου;
slca149	Πως και αυτό το ξαφνικό ενδιαφέρον στους ανιχνευτές μετάλλου, Manny;
slma150	Απλά είμαι συλλέκτης.
slma151	Θέλω να βρω κάτι κέρματα στον καναπέ μου.
slma152	Νομίζω ότι θα έδειχνε ωραίο στην ζώνη εργαλείων μου.
slma153	Απλά θέλω να το δανειστώ για ένα μυστικό σκοπό.
slca154	Καλά, θα σου το δείξω όταν κάνω διάλλειμα, τι λες;
slma155	Πότε κάνεις διάλλειμα;
slca156	Την αυγή.
slma157	Ωω, είναι πολύ αργά! Φορτώνω απόψε και φεύγω!
slca158	Ναι καλά...
slca159	Την έχω πατήσει με αυτήν την ατάκα ΠΑΡΑ πολλές φορές...
slma160	Νομίζω είναι ώρα για το διάλλειμά σου.
slma161	Μπορούμε να χωθούμε πίσω για ένα ποτάκι, να μου τα πεις όλα για τη δουλειά σου... τον κίνδυνο...
slma162	...τους ανιχνευτές μετάλλου...
slca163	Αυτό το πίσω δωμάτιο είναι όλο δουλειά, Manny, και εγώ το ίδιο.
slma164	Τι είδους δουλειά γίνεται εκεί πίσω, Carla;
slca165	Γδύσιμο και ψάξιμο, και δεν είσαι κατάλληλος.
slma166	Και γιατί δεν είμαι κατάλληλος για γδύσιμο και ψάξιμο;
slca167	Manny, συμφωνώ, θα βοηθούσε να περάσει η ώρα, αλλά έχουμε διαδικασίες και κανόνες εδώ...
slca168	...και ποτέ δεν ξέρεις πότε ΑΥΤΟΙ παρακολουθούν.
slca169	Μπορώ να τους γδύσω για ψάξιμο μόνο όταν το απλό ψάξιμο δεν βγάλει τίποτα.
slma170	Εϊ, αξίζει μια προσπάθεια.
slma171	Γιατί δεν περνάς από το club πια;
slca172	Για να σου πω την αλήθεια, Manny, είναι λόγω της κοπελιάς που ελέγχει τα παλτά.
slca173	Αυτή την τρελλάρα, θέλω να τη στραγγαλίσω!
slma174	Το δοκίμασα. Δεν τη σταματά αυτό.
slma175	Λοιπόν, τα λέμε, Carla.
slca176	Εντάξει, Manny.
slma177	Λοιπόν, δεν είναι η ώρα για το διάλλειμά σου ακόμη;
slca178	Σου είπα, όχι μέχρι την αυγή.
slca179	Είναι κάπως ρομαντικό πάντως, δε νομίζεις;
slca021	...και φυσικά με τον Μπαμπά μου να είναι στο στρατό, μετακινούμασταν συχνά...
slma022	Μμμμ-χμμμ.
slca023	Θυμάμαι εκείνη την πόλη που είχαμε μετακομίσει όταν ήμουν στην πρώτη τάξη...
slma024	Ωω, αλήθεια;
slca025	Ναι, η μόνη βιομηχανία στην περιοχή ήταν τα σύκα...
slca026	...εκτάρια και εκτάρια με συκιές, όπου και να κοιτούσες...
slca027	...Προσωπικά, ποτέ δε με ενδιέφεραν και πολύ τα σύκα.
slma028	Όχι, όχι. Ούτε εμένα.
slma029	Πραγματικά, τα σύκα αρέσουν σε κάποιους.
slca030	Πάντα μου άρεσαν περισσότερο οι χουρμάδες.
slma031	Μμμμμ. Χουρμάδες.
slca032	Ή δαμάσκηνα. Δεν τα λατρεύεις τα δαμάσκηνα;
slma033	Ποτέ δεν μου άρεσαν πολύ τα δαμάσκηνα.
slca034	Έχουν τόσο ωραία υφή...
slma035	Μιλώντας για ανιχνευτές μετάλλων...
slca036	Όλο ζαρωμένο σαν το πρόσωπο της Γιαγιάς μου της Hedwig...
slca037	...Ωω, καημένη Γιαγιά Hedwig...
slma038	Hedwig. Ενδιαφέρον όνομα...
slca039	...πάντα ξεχνούσε πράγματα.
slca040	Θυμάμαι μια φορά όταν ήμουν έξι χρονών...
slma041	Αα, έξι. Η χρυσή χρονιά.
slca042	...ή μάλλον ήμουν επτά...
slma043	Μάλλον ήσουν επτά.
slca044	όχι όχι όχι όχι...Πρέπει να ήμουν έξι γιατί ο κύριος Ruffus ζούσε ακόμα.
slma045	Ο κύριος Ruffus;
slma046	Αστείο, έτσι λένε και αυτόν που μου κλείνει τα στοιχήματα.
slma047	Μπορώ να κρατήσω των ανιχνευτή μετάλλου για λίγο;
slca048	Ήταν καλό σκυλί, ο κύριος Ruffus!
slma049	Σίγουρα.
slma050	Θυμάμαι είχα έναν σκύλο κάποτε...
slca051	Τι γλυκό κουτάβι, δε μας ένοιαζε που ήταν κουφό...
slma052	Εε; Τι είπες;  Χα χα.
slca053	Ήταν τελείως κουφάλογο, αλλά ακόμα και έτσι προσπαθούσε να γαυγίσει...
slma054	Έχεις φάει ποτέ φλούδα; Δεν είναι κακό.
slca055	...και θα κάνεις σαν γάτα που βήχει από μια μπάλα τρίχες...
slma056	Θυμάμαι είχα μια μπάλα τρίχες κάποτε...
slca057	...και η γάτα μου συχνά είχε, είχε τόσο μακριές τρίχες...
slma058	Ωω, γιάκκ.
slca059	Δεν μου πολυαρέσουν οι μακρύτριχες γάτες, εσένα, Manny;
slma060	Όχι, γιατί ο ταριχευτής χρεώνει έξτρα για αυτές.
slma061	Όχι, είναι πιο δύσκολο να τις βγάλεις από την ψηστιέρα.
slma062	Ξέρεις τι μου αρέσει; Οι ΑΝΙΧΝΕΥΤΕΣ ΜΕΤΑΛΛΩΝ!
slca063	Είναι τόσο...
slca064	Μου αρέσουν οι κοντότριχες γάτες.
slca065	Μοιάζουν λιγότερο ποζάτες.
slma066	Έχεις κάποιο δίκιο.
slca067	Οι άνθρωποι νομίζουν ότι είμαι πολύ ποζάτη μερικές φορές, είτε το πιστεύεις είτε όχι.
slma068	Όχι, απλά δεν μπορώ να το πιστέψω αυτό.
slma069	Βασικά, νόμιζα ότι ήσουν πολύ ποζάτη από την πρώτη στιγμή που σε γνώρισα.
slma070	Γιατί; Επειδή δεν τους άφηνες να αγγίξουν τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλων σου;
slca071	Όχι, πραγματικά το πιστεύουν. Δεν ξέρω γιατί.
slca072	Μάλλον είναι επειδή είμαι τόσο ντροπαλή...
slma073	Ναι, φαίνεσαι ντροπαλή.
slca074	Ήμουν ντροπαλή μέχρι το λύκειο...
slma075	Εγώ ήμουν τιμωρία μέχρι το λύκειο.
slca076	Ποτέ δεν πήγα ούτε για ένα χορό, το πιστεύεις αυτό;
slma077	Θα σε πάω για χορό απόψε αν με αφήσεις να δανειστώ αυτό το πράγμα!
slca078	Α-χα χα χο, μην με παρεξηγείς, τα αγόρια μου ζητούσαν, αλλά πάντα έφευγα μακριά.
slma079	Έφευγες. Αυτό ακούγεται πολύ καλό αυτή τη στιγμή...
slca080	Η μαμά μου έλεγε ότι θα μπορούσα να γίνω η βασίλισσα του χορού αποφοίτησης αν απλά χαμογελούσα μια στις τόσες...
slma081	Οι Μαμάδες έχουν πάντα δίκιο!
slma082	Η Μαμά σου πρέπει να σε αγαπούσε πάρα πολύ.
slma083	Εϊ, "Μαμά" Αρχίζει με "M." Ξέρεις τι άλλο αρχίζει με αυτό το γράμμα;
slca084	Πάντα έλεγε, "Ένα χαμόγελο είναι το πιο σημαντικό μέρος οποιασδήποτε ενδυμασίας!"
slca085	Ίσως να χαμογελούσα περισσότερο Μαμά, αν δεν έπινες τόσο πολύ!
slma086	Εε...
slma087	Οου...χμμ...
slma088	Θα χαμογελούσα περισσότερο αν είχα έναν ανιχνευτή μετάλλου.
slca089	Έπρεπε να χαμογελάσω όταν μας κάλεσαν οι μπάτσοι μέσα στη νύχτα για να μας πούνε να έρθουμε να σε βγάλουμε από τη δεξαμενή μεθυσμένο;
slma090	Εγώ...χμ...
slma091	...εε...
slca092	Ίσως αν χαμογελούσα περισσότερο, ο Μπαμπάς να μη μας είχε αφήσει!
slma093	Ουάου.
slma094	Πρέπει οπωσδήποτε να φύγω.
slma095	Ίσως ο Μπαμπάς έφυγε γιατί δεν ΜΟΙΡΑΖΟΣΟΥΝ πράγματα...
slca096	Θα ήμασταν μαζί τώρα, εσύ, εγώ, ο Μπαμπάς...
slca097	...και η Γιαγιά Hedwig, και ο κύριος Ruffus...
slma098	Αυτό μου θύμισε, ότι πρέπει να τηλεφωνήσω αυτόν που μου κλείνει τα στοιχήματα...
slca099	...και θα φοράω το βασιλικό στέμμα της επιστροφής μου στο σπίτι και θα τρώω σύκα και...
slma100	Ναιιι...Σύκα...
slma101	Και θα παίζω με τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλου σου;

slca106	...ΩΧ ΜΑΝΑ ΜΟΥ!  Εχ-χα-χα-ωωχ!
slma107	Ω Θεέ μου.
slma108	Ίσως θέλεις να μείνεις μόνος τώρα.
slma109	Ξέχνα τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλου!
slca110	Λυπάμαι τόσο πολύ!
slca111	Ουααααααα!
slma112	Τώρα, τώρα.
slma113	Μην κλαις.
slma114	Εδώ, δώσε μου να σου κρατήσω τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλου όσο θα κλαις...
slca115	Ουαααααα!  Μαμααά!
slca116	Μπουαααα, αααααα!
slma117	Ενδιαφέρον.
slma118	Δεν βρίσκεις;
slma119	Εϊ, Carla. Πάρα πολύ ωραίος ανιχνευτής μετάλλου αυτός που έχεις.
slca120	Μήπως γύρισες πίσω για να μου ζητήσεις να δανειστείς τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλου μου;
slca121	Είσαι σίγουρος ότι δεν γύρισες εδώ για τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλου;
slma122	Ναι.
slca123	Μα ΤΙ συμβαίνει με εσένα και αυτό το πράγμα;
slca124	Το σιχάθηκα, Manny!
slca125	Αν αυτό είναι που θέλεις, μπορείς να παλέψεις με τις γάτες για να το πάρεις!
slca126	Γιατί όλοι οι άντρες θέλουν το ίδιο πράγμα--
slca127	Εκτός από σένα;!
slca128	Η μόνη γυναίκα που σε ενδιαφέρει είναι αυτή η κυρά Colomar, που στην κοπάνησε!

slma130	Carla...
slma131	Αποκλείεται.
slma132	Βασικά, όντως ήρθα εδώ μόνο για τον ανιχνευτή μετάλλου.
slma133	Φυσικά. Είμαι εδώ για την εταιρία.
slca134	Ε, ok. Τώρα, που ήμουν;
slca135	Α, ναι--λοιπόν η μόνη βιομηχανία στην πόλη ήταν ΣΥΚΩΝ...

tbma040	Εγώ δεν τζογάρω--Είναι κόντρα στο συμφέρον μου.

hhma007	Αυτό είναι το ασανσέρ για τη Λέσχη του Ριψοκίνδυνου Χαρτοπαίκτη.
hhra008	Ω, συγγνώμη monsieur, αλλά αυτό είναι το ασανσέρ για τη Λέσχη του Ριψοκίνδυνου Χαρτοπαίκτη.
hhma009	Εκεί πάω.
hhra010	Είναι μόνο για μέλη.
hhma011	Πρέπει να είσαι καινούργιος.
hhra012	Και πρέπει να έχεις και V.I.P. κάρτα εισόδου για να έρθεις επάνω.
hhra013	Adieu.
hhra014	Πάλι εσύ;
hhma015	Ήμουν έτοιμος να πω το ίδιο πράγμα.
hhra016	Συγγνώμη, monsieur, αλλά δεν μπορείτε να έρθετε επάνω χωρίς κάρτα εισόδου!
hhra017	Λυπάμαι, Monsieur αλλά--
hhma018	Ορίστε η κάρτα εισόδου μου, Jean-Claude, τώρα κλείσε τις πόρτες και οδήγα.
hhra019	Oui, Monsieur...
hhra020	(...αλλά στην πραγματικότητα, με λένε Raoul.)
hlma094	Θέλω να σου πω μια θλιβερή ιστορία ενός νεαρού άνδρα, φυλακίστηκε άδικα, απλά επειδή έλεγε τη γνώμη του...
hlma095	Κοίτα τι βρήκα στο θάλαμο του photo finish...
hlma096	Φαίνεται ότι το "’τακτό Γατί" και ο "Κακός Γάτος" είναι λαιμό με λαιμό...
hlvi097	Τι θέλεις;
hlma098	Θα σου πω αφού το σκεφτώ.
hlma099	Καλύτερα να μείνεις εδώ γύρω.
hlgl100	Πήγαινε, γατάκι!
hlgl101	Πςςς-πςςς-Πςςς πςςς-πςςς-πςςς!!
hlgl102	Ναι!
hlgl103	Είσαι καλό γατί!
hlgl104	Πιάσε το ποντίκι!
hlgl105	Τρέχα!
hlgl106	Μπορείς να το κάνεις!
hlgl107	Pitty-pat! Pitty-pat! Pitty-pat! Pitty-pat! Pitty-pat!
hlgl108	Πήγαινε, πήγαινε, πήγαινε!
hlgl109	Έλα!
hlgl110	Το έπιασες!
hlgl111	Νιάου, μωρό μου!
hlgl112	Τι είναι αυτό;
hlgl113	Ω, για όνομα του Θεού!
hlgl114	Σήκω πάνω, χαζή γάτα!
hlgl115	Πατούσες στον αέρα, πάμε!
hlgl116	Αυτό είναι!
hlgl117	Το πετυχαίνεις!!
hlgl118	Ρίχτου!
hlgl119	Σχεδόν το πέτυχες!
hlgl120	Έλα, το μωρό χρειάζεται καινούργιο ζευγάρι γυαλιά!
hlgl121	Γκάζωσε στις ευθείες, γατάκι!
hlgl122	Έτσι αρέσει στον Μπαμπά!
hlgl123	Εϊ, Pierre!
hlgl124	Εϊ, Rosencranz!
hlgl125	Yo, Frenchie!

hlgl137	Εε, monsieur, λίγο κρααααασί εδώ πάνω, παρακαλώ!
hlgl138	Εε, μη με κάνεις να έρθω εκεί κάτω να το πάρω, ζαρωμένο δοκάρι από δέρμα!
hltx139	Glottis
hlma140	Ω, αν ήξερα μόνο...
hlma141	Τέρμα το παιχνίδι, Lucky!
hlma142	Είναι ώρα να φύγουμε.
hlgl143	Φύγε, όποιος και αν είσαι!
hlgl144	Νιώθω να μου έρχεται ρέντα!
hlma145	Έλα, Glottis, φεύγουμε. ΤΩΡΑ.
hlgl146	ΓΚΑΡΣΟΝ! ΑΥΤΟΣ Ο ΜΕΘΥΣΜΕΝΟΣ ΤΥΠΟΣ ΜΕ ΕΝΟΧΛΕΙ!!!
hlma147	Δεν είχα ιδέα ότι σου άρεσε τόσο πολύ ο τζόγος, Glottis.
hlgl148	Οι γιατροί με έβαλαν να υποσχεθώ ότι δεν θα το ξανακάνω!
hlgl149	ΑΛΛΑ ΔΕΝ ΜΠΟΡΟΥΝ ΝΑ ΜΠΟΥΝ ΣΤΗ ΛΕΣΧΗ ΤΟΥ ΡΙΨΟΚΙΝΔΥΝΟΥ ΧΑΡΤΟΠΑΙΚΤΗ, ΜΠΟΡΟΥΝ;;;
hlma150	Θα έρθεις σπίτι σύντομα;
hlgl151	Σςςς! Οραματίζομαι!
hlma152	Glottis, Έχω κάτι πολύ ενδιαφέρον εδώ...
hlgl153	Τι είπες, μικρό γατάκι;
hlgl154	Μη μιλάς γατάκι! Απλά τρέχα, μωρό μου!
hltx155	statue
hlma156	Ποιος χρειάζεται μια γιγάντια, χρυσή γάτα 24-καρατιών;
hlma157	Αα, Ποιος χρειάζεται μια γάτα, τελειωτικά;
hlma158	Νομίζω ότι θα με προσέξουν να φεύγω από δω μέσα με αυτό.
hlma159	Καλό γατί.

hltx163	Virago
hlma164	Αδερφέ μου, αυτός ο Nick πολύ κυκλοφορεί.
hlma165	Φαίνεται ότι ο Nick κάνει λίγο χαρτοδουλειά που είχε αφήσει πίσω.
hlma166	Εϊ, Ζαχαρό-χειλη!
hlvi167	Τι θέλεις από μένα, Calavera!
hlma168	Χμμμμμ....
hlma169	Δεν μπορώ να σκεφτώ κάτι ακόμα.

hlma172	Αυτό μου θύμισε, ακόμα δεν έχω κάνει τη φορολογική μου δήλωση.

hltx174	case
hlma175	Είναι η τσιγαροθήκη του Virago.
hlma176	Δικέ μου, αυτό θα με βάλει σε μπελάδες.
hlma177	Υπάρχει κάτι αξίας μέσα...
hlma178	Πρέπει να είναι σε κρυμμένο τμήμα κάπου, αλλά δε βλέπω την μπετούγια ή κάτι σχετικό.
hlma179	Ρρρρ!
hlma180	Δε μπορώ να ανοίξω το τμήμα που νομίζω ότι έχει το κλειδί μέσα!
hlma181	Δε νομίζω ότι με αυτό θα πάρω το κλειδί.

hlma185	Δε νομίζω ότι θα ήταν καλή ιδέα να μπουκάρω μέσα στο γραφείο του Max ενώ είναι σε συνάντηση με τον Nick.
hltx184	door
hlma001	Ok, οπότε αυτός ο δικηγόρος, η μητέρα του, και ένα κοτόπουλο είναι όλα πάνω σε αυτή τη σωσίβια λέμβο, βλέπεις...
hlma002	Αρχίζουν να πεινάνε, και το κοτόπουλο λέει...
hlvi003	Έχω ένα όπλο, Manuel.
hlma004	Έχεις σημάδι από κραγιόν, ερωτόπαιδο.
hlvi005	Το ξεφορτώθηκα ήδη αυτό, και μπορώ να κάνω το ίδιο και με σένα, Calavera...
hlvi006	...οπότε αν ήμουν στη θέση σου θα κρατούσα το σαγόνι μου κλειστό.
hlma007	Nick Virago! Τι δουλειά έχεις να εργάζεσαι στη Λέσχη του Ριψοκίνδυνου Χαρτοπαίκτη;
hlma008	Θα φανταζόμουν ότι ο προσωπικός δικηγόρος του Maximino θα είχε το δικό του γραφείο.
hlvi009	Έχω, αλλά δεν σερβίρουν ποτά εκεί.
hlma010	Πως πάνε τα κόλπα, Nick;
hlvi011	Μμμ.
hlma012	Nick, χρειάζομαι έναν δικηγόρο.
hlvi013	Μπήκες σε τίποτα μπελάδες, Calavera;
hlvi014	Ποιο είναι το πρόβλημα τώρα;
hlma015	Ένας φίλος μου είναι στη στενή.
hlvi016	Χμμμ...
hlma017	Όχι, απλά χρειαζόμαστε κάποιον για το θάλαμο βουτήγματος στο club.
hlvi018	Αστείος τύπος.
hlma019	Κάποιος ισχυρίζεται ότι οι ρουλέτες μου είναι "πειραγμένες".
hlvi020	Μα οι ρουλέτες σου ΕΙΝΑΙ πειραγμένες.
hlma021	Ακριβώς. Γι'αυτό χρειάζομαι δικηγόρο.
hlma022	Θα ξεκινήσω μια αγωγή. Είναι πολλά λεφτά στη μέση...
hlvi023	Ποιόν θα ξαλαφρώσεις από τα λεφτά του;
hlma024	Τι διαφορά κάνει σε σένα; Αυτοί είναι φορτωμένοι.
hlvi025	Χμμμ. Εξαναγκασμός.
hlma026	Βασικά, προσπαθώ να υιοθετήσω τον Glottis.
hlvi027	Manny, αυτό το δαιμόνιο είναι πάνω από δύο χιλιάδες χρόνια μεγαλύτερος από σένα.
hlma028	Όχι εδώ πάνω δεν είναι.
hlma029	Χρειάζεται καθοδήγηση.
hlvi030	Καταλαβαίνω.
hlvi031	Θα σε ρωτήσω πάλι...
hlvi032	Λοιπόν...θα χρειαστείς κανονικό δικηγόρο, ή έναν ΑΡΙΣΤΟ δικηγόρο;
hlvi033	Θα χρειαστείς κανονικό δικηγόρο, ή έναν ΑΡΙΣΤΟ δικηγόρο;
hlma034	Οποιοσδήποτε δικηγόρος του ποινικού μου κάνει.
hlvi035	Τότε να προτείνω να ψάξεις στο χρυσό οδηγό;
hlma036	Ένας άριστος δικηγόρος.
hlvi037	Ένας οποιοσδήποτε άριστος δικηγόρος... ή ο ΚΑΛΥΤΕΡΟΣ άριστος δικηγόρος;
hlma038	Τι σημασία έχει, αν είναι άριστοι;
hlvi039	Έχει σημασία αν ο τύπος που θα αντιμετωπίσεις έχει τον ΚΑΛΥΤΕΡΟ.
hlma040	Τότε φαντάζομαι θα χρειαστώ τον καλύτερο.
hlma041	Ο καλυτερότερος είναι αρκετά καλός για μένα.
hlvi042	Και Ποιος λες να είναι, Calavera;
hlvi043	Ποιος θα έλεγες ότι είναι ο ΚΑΛΥΤΕΡΟΣ δικηγόρος που ξέρεις, σε όλη τη Χώρα των Νεκρών;
hlma044	Εσύ, Nick.
hlvi045	Σωστά, και γι'αυτό ο Maximino με κρατάει σε ΑΠΟΚΛΕΙΣΤΙΚΗ βάση.
hlvi046	Οπότε, συγγνώμη, αλλά δεν κάνω... "δουλειές του ποδαριού."
hlma047	Λοιπόν, ο ΚΑΛΥΤΕΡΟΣ δικηγόρος θα πρέπει να είναι ένας νεκρός δικηγόρος.
hlvi048	Αυτό μας περιορίζει μονάχα σε όλους εδώ στη Χώρα των Νεκρών.
hlvi049	Έλα πάλι όταν θα ξέρεις περισσότερα για το τι ακριβώς θέλεις.
hlvi050	Και, παρεμπιπτόντως, Manny...
hlvi051	Τα Δικηγορικά αστεία... δεν είναι αστεία.
hlma052	Δεν έχω χρόνο για παιχνίδια, Virago.
hlvi053	Ούτε εγώ, οπότε έλα πάλι όταν θα μπορείς να είσαι σοβαρός.
hlma054	Τώρα που το ξανασκέφτομαι, δεν μου πολυχρειάζεται.
hlvi055	Όλοι χρειάζονται έναν, τελικά.
hlvi056	Ειδοποίησε με όταν θα χρειαστείς!
hlma057	Virago, ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΑ χρειάζομαι δικηγόρο.
hlvi058	Το πρόγραμμά μου είναι γεμάτο, οπότε τι θα κάνεις;
hlvi059	Τι είναι αυτή τη φορά, Calavera;
hlma060	Θα ρωτήσω τον Max αν μπορώ να σε δανειστώ.
hlvi061	Δεν του αρέσει να αποχωρίζεται το σύμβουλό του περισσότερο απ'όσο του αρέσει να μοιράζεται τη φιλενάδα του, οπότε μην κάνεις τον κόπο.
hlma062	Θα μπορούσα να σε πληρώσω περισσότερα από αυτόν.
hlvi063	Manny, κοίτα γύρω σου.
hlvi064	Ο Maximino θα μπορούσε να αγοράσει το μαγαζί σου και να το χρησιμοποιήσει για σκουπιδοτενεκέ.
hlma065	Θα μπορούσα να σε αναγκάσω να το κάνεις με αυτό το όπλο!
hlvi066	Αν οποιοσδήποτε σε αυτή την πόλη είχε όπλα εκτός από εμάς...
hlvi067	...θα το ξέραμε.
hlma068	Θα μπορούσα να πω στον Max για σένα και την Olivia.
hlvi069	Ένας τέτοιος ισχυρισμός θα μπορούσε να γεμίσει κάποιον σαν τον Max με μεγάλη οργή.
hlvi070	Ειδικά αν ο αγγελιοφόρος δεν έχει αποδείξεις.
hlma071	Ο Max και εγώ είμαστε φίλοι. Θα με πιστέψει.
hlvi072	Οι άνθρωποι πιστεύουν αυτό που θέλουν να πιστέψουν, Calavera...
hlvi073	...και εγώ θέλω να πιστεύω ότι είσαι ένας έξυπνος άνθρωπος που δεν διαδίδει επικίνδυνες φήμες.
hlvi074	Πρέπει να πάω να μιλήσω στον Max ένα λεπτό.
hlvi075	Όταν επιστρέψω, ελπίζω να έχεις φύγει, γιατί σιχάθηκα να σε βλέπω.
hlma076	Θα μπορούσα να βρω έναν άλλο δικηγόρο.
hlvi077	Τέλεια ιδέα.
hlma078	Όλα νόμιμα με τις γατούλες;
hlvi079	Ναι, διατηρούνται πολύ καθαρές.
hlma080	Ποια προτιμάς στην τέταρτη κούρσα;
hlvi081	Λοιπόν, είναι η άσπρο-πόδαρη γάτα στην πύλη δύο που μοιάζει δυνατή αλλά έχει μια ήπια μόλυνση στο μάτι...
hlma082	Αλλά νομίζεις ότι θα το ξεπεράσει και θα νικήσει έτσι και αλλιώς, σωστά;
hlvi083	Όχι, αυτή η γκαβωμένη γάτα θα χάσει!
hlvi084	Αλλά κανείς δεν ξέρει--και σκοπεύω να κάνω μια περιουσία!
hlma085	Πρέπει να το πω αυτό σε κάποιον: Μισώ τις γάτες.
hlvi086	Και γω, αλλά με αυτές κινείται το μέρος εδώ.
hlma087	Χάρηκα που σε είδα, Nick.
hlvi088	Και γω το ίδιο.
hlvi089	Βασικά, άσε με να μαντέψω...
hlvi090	Πρέπει να θέλεις δικηγόρο για την κοινωνική θέση, σωστά;
hlvi091	Για το ίδιο πράγμα με θέλει και ο Max, αλλά βλέπεις...
hlvi092	Αυτός μπορεί να με πληρώνει.
hlvi093	Καλημέρα, Calavera.
hkgl001	ΚΑΠΟΙΟΣ χαζολογάει στη δουλειά!
hkgl002	Aχ! Είναι άδειο!
hkgl003	Ruben! Που είσαι;
hkgl004	Αα-χα!
hkra005	Ω, mon dieu!
hkgl006	Παίρνουμε έναν ΥΠΝΑΚΟ-ay-vous, ε;
hkgl007	Λοιπόν, LE βαρελάκι είναι LE άδειο, άρα φέρε γλυκό κρασί, φιλαράκι!
hkra008	Ναι monsieur, merci, ότι πείτε εσείς!
hkra009	Aitor! ΚΙ ΑΛΛΟ ΚΡΑΣΙ!
hkra010	Θα τον απολύσω επειδή αγνοεί τα παρακάλια μου, και μετά πιστεύω θα παραιτηθώ.
hkra011	Δεν μπορώ να ξαναδώ αυτό το κελάρι...
hkra012	Κανείς άνθρωπος δεν θα έπρεπε να κλειδωθεί ποτέ μέσα σε ένα τόσο μικρό, σκοτεινό μέρος.
hkma013	Ουφφ.
hkma014	Αχ!
hkma015	Ε!
hkma016	Μοιάζουν με κονσέρβες... κονσερβοποιημένο κρέας.
hkma017	Ωχ, πραγματικά ελπίζω να μην καταλήγουν εδώ οι γέρικες γάτες αγώνων.
hkma018	Περισσότερο από αυτό το γάτο-κρέας, ή ότι άλλο είναι.
hkra019	ΤΙ ΚΑΝΕΙΣ;;;
hkma020	Ήθελα λίγο κρασί.
hkra021	Ω, κοίτα τι χάλια που τα έκανες!
hkra022	Έξω από δω!
hkma023	Εϊ, και με το κρασί μου τι θα γίνει;
hkra024	Είμαι απασχολημένος να κρατάω το ποτήρι αυτού του τέρατος γεμάτο!
hkra025	Δεν είναι σελφ-σέρβις!
hkra026	Θα πρέπει να περιμένεις μέχρι να το αποφύγω!
hkra027	Σου είπα να μείνεις έξω από δω!
hkma028	Δε θα χρειαζόταν να έρχομαι εδώ μέσα αν το σέρβις ήταν λίγο πιο γρήγορο.
hkra029	Χμφ!
hkra030	Aitor;
hkra031	Μπορείς να ξαναλλάξεις τα βαρέλια;
hkra032	Αυτό το απαίσιο ΔΑΙΜΟΝΙΟ--
hkra033	--Χωρίς παρεξήγηση, φυσικά--
hkra034	’δειασε ακόμα ένα.
hkra035	Με συγχωρείτε.
hkra036	Excusez moi!
hkra037	Αχ!
hkra038	Συγγνώμη!
hkra039	Je suis disoli.
hkra040	Je vous prie de m'excuser.
hkra041	Je suis navri.
hkra042	Je vous prie de m'excuser monsieur.
hkra043	Quel maladroit je fais!
hkra044	Je vous prisente mes excuses.
hkra045	Je suis confus.
hkra046	Disoli.
hkra047	Disoli monsieur.
hkra048	Ah, mille excuses.
hkra049	Αυτό το τέρας επάνω με έχει εξαντλήσει!
hkra050	Oh, but monsieur! Je suis tres disoli...
hkra051	Δεν επιτρέπονται επισκέπτες μέσα στην κουζίνα!
hkra052	Πρέπει να σας ζητήσω να φύγετε.
hkma053	Σε ένα λεπτό, LeRois.
hkra054	Raoul.
hkra055	Έξω από την κουζίνα παρακαλώ.
hkra056	Είναι πολύ κακό που είσαι εδώ μέσα.
hkra057	Δεν θα έπρεπε να είσαι εδώ πίσω.
hkra058	Παρακαλώ να μην είσαι εδώ πίσω.
hkra059	S'il vous plait, monsieur!
hkra060	Εσύ! Έξω παρακαλώ!
hkra061	Oh, monsieur.
hkra062	Merci.
hkra063	Όταν επιστρέψω και σε βρω εδώ, για το καλό σου να έχεις φύγει!
hkra064	Ωωωωω! Σε ΠΑΡΑΚΑΛΩ μην το κάνεις αυτό.
hkra065	Δεν μου αρέσουν τα μικροσκοπικά μέρη, monsieur, όχι-όχι-όχι καθόλου.
hkra066	Δεν έχω το χρόνο για τέτοια παιχνίδια...
hkra067	Αν δεν πάω αυτά τα ποτά, οι πελάτες θα ορμίσουν στην κουζίνα ψάχνοντας για τις παραγγελίες τους.
hkra068	Allo?
hkra069	Alloooo εκεί έξω!
hkra070	Μπορεί κάποιος να ανοίξει την πόρτα;
hkra071	Χε, χε... εγώ... εε... χε, χε!
hkra072	Φαίνεται ότι, ε, κλειδώθηκα μέσα σ'αυτό το μικροσκοπικό δωμάτιο!
hkra073	Είμαι ποοοοολυυυυυύ κλειστοφοβικός οπότε, αν κάποιος, εε...
hkra074	...s'il vous plait...
hkra075	SIL VOUS PLAIT!!! Oh!
hkra076	ΒΓΑΛΤΕ ΜΕ ΕΞΩ ΑΠΟ ΔΩ IM-MED-I-ATE-MENT!!!

hkma082	Χμμμ... Δεν ακούω τον Rupert εκεί μέσα πια...
hkma083	Είναι γεμάτο νερό.
hkma084	Μοιάζει με το κελάρι.
hkma085	Μπα, αν βγάλω το σερβιτόρο έξω τώρα, θα με σουτάρει από το club!
hkma086	Αυτό θα έπρεπε να εμποδίζει το φαγητό να φύγει.
hktx087	turkey baster
hkma088	Είναι ένα λαδωτήρι γαλοπούλας γεμάτο με βρώμικο νερό ναργιλέ.
hkma089	Μοιάζει με λαδωτήρι γαλοπούλας.
hkma090	Δεν θέλω να τιναχτεί όλο αυτό το νερό ναργιλέ εδώ μέσα.

hkma098	Νομίζω θα μπορούσα να χωρέσω εκεί μέσα.
hkma099	Αυτό το βαρέλι είναι και σφραγισμένο στην κορυφή.
hkma100	Δεν υπάρχει άνοιγμα εδώ πάνω.
hkma101	Καλύτερα να μην το ανοίξω όταν είναι γεμάτο.
hkma102	Θα μπορούσα να χύσω πολύ ζουμί...
hktx103	spigot
hkma104	Αν μπορούσα να συρθώ μέσα από το σιφόνι, θα μπορούσα να κρυφτώ εκεί μέσα.
hkma105	Έχω μια διαίσθηση ότι το κρασί βγαίνει από δω.
hkma106	Τίποτα.

heai004	Για που;
hema005	Το ασανσέρ.
heai006	Αμφιβάλλω.
hema007	Πας κάτω;
heai008	Πιθανόν.
heai009	Αργότερα.
hema010	Δεν μπορώ να πάω κάτω στο κελάρι;
heai011	Είναι κελάρι κρασιού.
heai012	Το κρασί πάει εκεί κάτω.
hema013	Ίσως θα μπορούσες να με πετάξεις μέχρι κάτω τώρα;
heai014	Ω, ναι, θα μπορούσα να σε πετάξω κάτω...
heai015	Αλλά δεν μπορώ να χτυπήσω πελάτες πια.
hema016	Κάτω με το ΑΣΑΝΣΕΡ. Θέλω να πάω κάτω με το ασανσέρ.
heai017	Αυτό είναι αλήθεια... δεν θα με έβλεπαν να σε χτυπάω εκεί μέσα...
heai018	Αλλά πάλι θα μπορούσα να βρω το μπελά μου.
hema019	Γιατί δεν μπορείς να χτυπάς πελάτες πια;
heai020	Ακριβώς! Είναι ακατανόητο!
hema021	Απλά άνοιξε την πόρτα του ασανσέρ.
heai022	Τότε σίγουρα θα μας δουν να παλεύουμε!

hema025	Κοίτα, θέλω μόνο μια μεταφορά, εντάξει;
heai026	Δεν είμαι οδηγός.
heai027	Είμαι ένα πνεύμα της φύσης, που δημιουργήθηκε με ένα σκοπό, μια ικανότητα, έναν πόθο.
hema028	Να με σταματήσεις από το να χρησιμοποιήσω το ασανσέρ;
heai029	Όχι, αλλά και αυτό ακούγεται καλό.
heai030	Νομίζω θα κάνω αυτό από δω και στο εξής.
hema031	Τι θα έλεγες για μια δωροδοκία;
heai032	Κοίταξε με.
heai033	Τι μπορείς να δώσεις σε κάποιον που έχει τα πάντα;
hema034	Συγγνώμη για το φίλο μου. Θα τον πάρω από δω αν θέλεις.

mxmx054	Ήρθες να δεις πως παίζουν τα μεγάλα αγόρια, ε Manny;
mxma055	Απ'όσο μπορώ να καταλάβω, παίζουν με γατούλες.
mxmx056	Γατούλες, ρουλέτες, Ποια είναι η διαφορά;

mxma075	Πίστωση; Πως πήρε ο Glottis πίστωση;
mxmx076	Έχει μέρος στην ιδιοκτησία του club σου, έτσι δεν είναι;
mxma077	Έχει το μισό, για την ακρίβεια.
mxmx078	Λοιπόν, έβαλε το καταγώγιο υποθήκη, οπότε έχεις δουλειά...
mxmx079	Έχει και αυτός δουλειά!
mxma002	Πως πάει η κούρσα με τις γάτες, Max;
mxmx003	Ο όγκος έχει πέσει, οι περισσότεροι έχουν φύγει από την πόλη...
mxma004	Πες μου.
mxmx005	Αλλά έχω μια παράλληλη δουλειά που βοηθά να εξομαλύνω κάποια άσχημα σημεία.
mxma006	Τι είδους παράλληλη δουλειά;
mxmx007	Ου-χα-χα-χα, Manny...
mxmx008	Ας πούμε ότι οι συνεργάτες μας του El Marrow εκτιμούν την... εκτός πόλης προοπτική μας.
mxma009	Ξέρεις, έχεις μια πολύ καλή εγκατάσταση εδώ.
mxmx010	Και εσύ έχεις ένα πολύ καλό club, Manny.
mxmx011	Όχι τόσο ωραίο όσο της φιλενάδας μου, φυσικά.
mxma012	Είπες, της φιλενάδας σου;
mxmx013	Εϊ, Manny. Μην κάνεις ότι δεν ακούς τα κουτσομπολιά...
mxmx014	Δεν είναι μυστικό πια--η Olivia και εγώ είμαστε επίσημα ένα.
mxma015	Μόλις είδα την Olivia και τον Nick να φιλιούνται.
mxmx016	Manny, όλοι φιλιόμαστε εδώ!
mxmx017	Είμαστε όλοι μια μεγάλη οικογένεια, ξέρεις;
mxma018	Όχι, εννοώ να ΦΙΛΙΟΥΝΤΑΙ Max.
mxmx019	Manny, η Olivia και εγώ είμαστε ερωτευμένοι.
mxmx020	Ο Nick Virago είναι έμπιστος σύμβουλός μου για χρόνια.
mxmx021	Δεν θα έπρεπε να αστειεύεσαι με αυτό τον τρόπο για το χαρακτήρα τους, θα μπορούσε να με εκνευρίσει πολύ.
mxma022	Δεν αστειεύομαι.
mxmx023	Αρκετά Calavera! Το εννοώ!
mxmx024	Τώρα... (αχμμ) ας μιλήσουμε για κάτι που μπορούμε να συμφωνήσουμε.

mxmx032	ΧΑ ΧΑ ΧΑ!
mxma033	ΧΑ χα. χοοο.
mxma034	Φεύγω από την πόλη απόψε.
mxmx035	Αυτό είναι ευχάριστο, Manuel!
mxmx036	Κανείς δεν χρειάζεται διακοπές περισσότερο από σένα!
mxmx037	Βγες από την πόλη, ξέχνα τη Meche!
mxma038	Μου αρέσει το καινούργιο αερόπλοιο.
mxmx039	Ναι, αποφάσισα να μην αφήσω αυτό που συνέβη στο Olivia 1 να με ρίξει.
mxmx040	Φαντάσου, προσπαθείς να εντυπωσιάσεις την κοπέλα σου φτιάχνοντας της ένα μεγάλο αερόπλοιο, και τι γίνεται;
mxmx041	Πάει και πέφτει, εκρήγνυται και καίγεται πάνω στην ίδια σου την πίστα--και σκοτώνει και την αγαπημένη σου γάτα!
mxmx042	Δεν είναι το πράγμα που κάνει την καρδιά ενός νεαρού κοριτσιού να φτερουγίσει, στο ξαναλέω!
mxma043	Ο νέος σου σερβιτόρος έχει πολύ τουπέ.
mxma044	Ακόμα και για τύπο σερβιτόρου που κοιτάζει αφ'υψηλού.
mxmx045	Εε, Manny, όταν βάζεις τέτοιες ταμπέλες στους ανθρώπους...
mxmx046	Είναι σαν να χώνεις τους ανθρώπους σε αυτά τα μικρά κουτάκια, και ποτέ δεν τους βγάζεις έξω.
mxma047	Είμαστε ΟΛΟΙ σε μικρά κουτάκια πίσω στο σπίτι, Max--Δύο μέτρα κάτω από τη γη.
mxmx048	Τώρα μιλάς σαν ιατροδικαστής της πόλης, Manny!
mxmx049	Κόφτο!
mxma050	Λοιπόν, θα σε αφήσω να συνεχίσεις να κοιτάς έξω από το παράθυρο...
mxmx051	Απλά δε χορταίνω τις γάτες μου!
pima002	Εϊ, Terry, ήταν ωραίος ο λόγος σου εκεί έξω!
pite003	Ναι ίσως ήταν, αλλά με προσγείωσε εδώ μέσα!
pima004	Μην ανησυχείς. Θα σου βρω τον καλύτερο δικηγόρο στην πόλη!
pite005	Ok, Manny, αλλά γρήγορα, πριν το κίνημα χάσει τη βοή του!

suma030	Όχι, πραγματικά. Το μαργαριτάρι είναι ακριβώς εκεί πέρα!
such031	Καημένο κοροΐδο, αυτό είναι το ΦΕΓΓΑΡΙ!
such032	Πες μου ότι δεν έκανες όλο αυτό το δρόμο μέχρι εδώ για να βουτήξεις για το μαργαριτάρι-φεγγάρι;  ουχ-χου-χου-χουυυυ!
suma033	Θα μπορούσες να στείλεις για βοήθεια;
such034	Ω, βέβαια!
such035	Υπόσχομαι να καλέσω βοήθεια στον επόμενο τηλεφωνικό θάλαμο που θα βρω.
suma036	Τι κάνεις εδώ κάτω;
such037	Προσπαθώ να φύγω από τη Χώρα των Νεκρών, το ίδιο με όλους!
suma038	Γιατί πας με τα πόδια αντί να πάρεις καράβι;
such039	Βαρέθηκα να περιμένω στη Rubacava για πλοίο!
such040	Υπολόγισα ότι θα κάνω καλύτερο χρόνο έτσι.
suma041	Γιατί δεν το σκέφτηκα εγώ αυτό;
suma042	Πως καταλαβαίνεις που πας;
such043	Βλέπεις το φεγγάρι εκεί πέρα;
such044	Απλά φροντίζω να το έχω στα δεξιά μου, έτσι ξέρω ότι ακολουθώ ευθεία γραμμή!
such045	Είναι το παλιότερο κόλπο!
suma046	Είναι όλα εντάξει με τα φρύδια σου;
such047	Είναι από στρείδια, έξυπνε!
such048	Δεν κινούμαι αρκετά γρήγορά για να τα αποτινάξω, οπότε έχουν την τάση να στοιβάζονται.
such049	Δεν με πειράζουν όμως--είναι η μόνη παρέα που έχω!
such050	Χεε χεε, έτσι δεν είναι παιδιά;
suma051	Πόσο καιρό είσαι εδώ κάτω;
such052	Λοιπόν, θα στο θέσω έτσι--
such053	Δεν είχα πάντα αυτό το χρώμα!
suma054	Δεν θα έπρεπε να είχες φτάσει σε στεριά μέχρι τώρα;
such055	Προσπαθώ να διασχίσω ένα μεγάλο ωκεανό, γιόκα μου, αλλά τι να ξέρεις εσύ;
suma056	Το έχω ήδη κάνει, με ΠΛΟΙΟ.
such057	Πλοίο! Μη μου λες εμένα για πλοία!
suma058	Ποιο είναι το πρόβλημα με τα πλοία;
sugl059	Είχαμε ένα τόσο ωραίο πλοίο...
such060	Γιατί όλοι πάντα μιλάνε για πλοία;
such061	Έχεις ένα άψογο ζευγάρι πόδια, γιατί να μην τα χρησιμοποιήσεις;
suma062	’σε με να μαντέψω. Πέθανες σε ναυάγιο;
such063	Ένα ναυάγιο θα μπορούσε να είναι καλύτερο από αυτό που συνέβη σε μάς!
such064	Βγήκαμε εκτός πορείας εξαιτίας κακού εξοπλισμού, χαμένοι για εβδομάδες, χωρίς φαγητό, χωρίς καταφύγιο από τον ήλιο...
such065	Αρχίσαμε να πετάμε τους νεκρούς στη θάλασσα, αλλά μετά οι καρχαρίες άρχισαν να ακολουθούν το καράβι...
suma066	Τι συνέβη στο τέλος;
such067	Τ-τι συνέβη στο τέλος;
suma068	Όταν είχατε ακινητοποιηθεί στη θάλασσα!
such069	Ω, σου είπα για αυτό;
such070	Νόμιζα ότι ήταν κάποιος άλλος που σου έμοιαζε.
such071	Αυτό που έγινε ήταν ότι έμαθα τρία πολύτιμα μαθήματα:
such072	Μείνε μακριά από πλοία,
such073	Όσον αφορά την πλοήγηση, να εμπιστεύεσαι μόνο το φεγγάρι και τα αστέρια,
such074	...και όταν έχετε μείνει μόνο δύο, ποτέ μα ποτέ μην κοιμηθείς.
suma075	Πως κράτησες αυτό το φως αναμμένο όλα αυτά τα χρόνια;
such076	Λοιπόν, βρήκα αυτό το κοράλλι, που φωτίζει στο σκοτάδι...
such077	Περίεργο πράμα...
such078	Λάμπει σαν πυγολαμπίδα και ποτέ δε σβήνει.
suma079	Είχα ένα τέτοιο κάποτε, έφτιαξε έναν ωραίο γάντζο.
such080	Δε νομίζω να είχες το ίδιο με το δικό μου, γιατί δε νομίζω να έχεις πάει στο μέρος που το βρήκα!
suma081	Που βρήκες το κοράλλι;
such082	Στην άκρη του κόσμου, μικρέ!
such083	Εκεί είναι το μόνο μέρος που μεγαλώνει!
suma084	Λοιπόν, δεν θέλω να σε διακόψω αλλά...
such085	Ok, θα τα πούμε!
suma086	Να προσέχεις για τέρατα της θάλασσας!
such087	Ποιοι, αυτοί οι τύποι;
such088	Αα, δεν τα βάζουν με το γέρο Chepito!
such089	Είμαι πολύ έξυπνος γι'αυτά! Χε, χε, χε, χοοοο-χε!
such090	Χα-χα!
psma001	Ουυυυυ!
psma002	Πρόσεχε τα χέρια σου, μύδια.
psma003	Δεν πάω εκεί κάτω όταν αυτό το τέρας κοιτάει κατευθείαν πάνω μου!
pstx004	sub
psma005	Νομίζω βρήκαμε το μεταφορικό μας μέσο.
psma006	Δεν μπορώ να πλησιάσω πουθενά κοντά στο υποβρύχιο όσο αυτό το τέρας το φυλάει!
pstx007	octopus
psma008	Αυτό το χταπόδι ακολουθεί τα ίχνη μας...
psma009	Δεν είχα ιδέα ότι η όρασή τους ήταν τόσο καλή!
psma010	Δεν μπορείς να μιλήσεις στα χταπόδια.
pstx011	Το Pearl
psma012	ΥΠΑΡΧΕΙ λοιπόν στ' αλήθεια ένα μαργαριτάρι, αλλά αυτό σημαίνει ότι ο Meche πραγματικά πήδηξε από το καράβι εδώ;
psma013	Όλα μοιάζουν τόσο... ψαρωτικά.
psgl014	Χε χε. Καλό, Καπετάνιε.
psma015	Έχω πιο σημαντικά πράγματα στο μυαλό μου από το κλέψιμο κοσμημάτων.
psch016	Όχι εγώ!
pstx017	Glottis
psma018	Ακόμα δεν έγινε μπλε. Μήπως έχει μυστικά βράγχια πουθενά;
psma019	Glottis, πήγαινε εκεί κάτω και μίλα δαιμονέζικα σ'αυτό το χταπόδι.
psgl020	Με τίποτα! Φοβάμαι. Θα μείνω εδώ πάνω μαζί σου!
psch021	Μπρκ-μπρκ-μπρκ, ΒΡΑΑΑΑΑΑΑΑΑΚ!
pstx022	Chepito
psma023	Δικέ μου, δεν μπορούμε να ξεφορτωθούμε αυτό τον τύπο!
psma024	Δε νομίζω να το ξαναπιστέψει.
psma025	Εϊ, Chepito, βούτα, θα βουτήξεις;
psma026	Τραβάς πολύ την προσοχή επάνω μας!
psch027	Πολύ κακό!
psch028	Θα σου κολλήσω όπως τα στρείδια κολλάνε στα φρύδια μου, άρα ούτε να ΣΚΕΦΘΕΙΣ να την κοπανήσεις με το Pearl μου!
pstx029	lantern
psma030	Σίγουρα αυτό το φως τραβάει το χταπόδι!
psch031	Εϊ! Κάτω τα χέρια!
psch032	Τίποτα άλλο μέσα στην "προσωπική φούσκα" του Chepito εκτός από τον Chepito!
pstx033	barnacles
psma034	Όχι ακριβώς τόσο διάσημο όσο το "Πέρλα" είναι το μυθικό "Ο Γλοιώδης, με Στρείδια Σκεπασμένος, Παλιός Βράχος...".
psma035	Όταν γίνω τόσο απελπισμένος για φαγητό, ίσως.
psma036	Δεν θέλω να μπλεχτώ μέσα σ'αυτά!

eama005	Μελανιάζεις στις άκρες...

eama010	Υπάρχουν μερικά ακόμα φώτα προς αυτή την κατεύθυνση.

eama012	Glottis, θα τρυπώσω μέσα και θα ψάξω για την Meche.
eagl013	Και τι γίνεται αν εκείνο το χταπόδι επιστρέψει, όσο λείπεις;
eama014	Ζούλα το στο μάτι και κλέψε το υποβρύχιο του!

mnch123	Αλλά σίγουρα θα ήθελα να του κάνω ένα τεστ-ντράιβ!
mnch124	Βρε βρε, Μικρούλη Σφυράκι...
mnch125	Είσαι εντάξει!
mnma126	Έϊ, Chepi!
mnma127	Για κοίτα αυτές τις κάλτσες!

mnch129	Που τις βρήκες;
mnma130	Τις φορούσα από την αρχή!
mnch131	Και εσύ;
mnch132	Λοιπόν, τότε...
mnch133	Σου παρουσιάζω το νέο καλύτερο σου φίλο!
mnch134	Θέλεις να ανταλλάξεις κάτι για αυτές;

mnch137	Έχω τα πάντα!
mnch138	Έϊ, θα σου δώσω κάτι γι'αυτές.
mnma139	Λοιπόν...
mnma140	Αυτές είναι για να με κρατάνε ζεστό, έχεις κάτι που θα το κάνει αυτό;
mnch141	Τι λες για ένα όμορφο ημι-αυτόματο;
mnma142	Σύμφωνοι.
mnma143	Είναι γεμάτο;

mnma152	Δε θέλω να τα σπάσω-όλα αυτά.

mnma154	Βάζω στοίχημα ότι εκείνο το χταπόδι έφερε εδώ όλους αυτούς τους εργάτες του ορυχείου...

mnma156	ΠΑΡΑΤΗΣΤΕ ΤΑ ΕΡΓΑΛΕΙΑ ΣΑΣ!
mnma157	ΘΑ ΤΟ ΣΚΑΣΟΥΜΕ ΑΠΟ ΕΔΩ!
mnma158	Φίλε μου, αν είχα πάρει εκείνο το βιβλίο πίσω από τον Terry, θα μπορούσα ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΑ να ξεκινήσω αναταραχές εδώ.
mnma159	Φαίνονται να είναι αρκετά ικανοποιημένοι με τα εργαλεία που έχουν.
mnma160	Νομίζω ότι θα πρέπει να κάνω δουλειές μόνο με τον επικεφαλή έμπορο.
mnma161	Αυτοί οι άμοιροι άνθρωποι ήδη έχουν ταλαιπωρηθεί αρκετά.
mnma162	Εποφθαλμιούν το Σπάστα-Όλα που έχω, αλλά δεν πρόκειται να το αποκτήσουν!

mnma169	Εκείνο το μικρό σφυράκι μου φαίνεται ότι ταιριάζει περισσότερο στην ταχύτητα του.
mnma170	Ο Chepito δείχνει να ανίσχυρος να ελέγξει τα εργαλεία που διάλεξε.
mnma171	Αυτή ήταν η δουλειά του Glottis.
mnch172	Πάρ'το αυτό από μπροστά μου--Έχω τα δικά μου εργαλεία, ξέρεις!

mnch007	Κοίτα τα φρύδια μου!
mnch008	Τι;
mnma009	Λοιπόν, δεν στεκόσουν και σε πολύ ασφαλές σημείο...
mnch010	Ε λοιπόν, ούτε και εσύ στέκεσαι αυτή τη στιγμή, "Amigo."
mnma011	Ηρέμησε. Θα την κάνουμε από εδώ σύντομα.
mnch012	Εμείς;
mnch013	"Εμείς" τέρμα. Δεν ξαναταξιδεύουμε μαζί.
mnch014	Δουλεύω, μόνος, φίλε μου, και προχωράω...
mnch015	...μοναχός.
mnma016	Ωραίο τρυπάνι.

mnch018	Αυτή εδώ είναι μία ασύρματη, υψηλής-ταχύτητας, παλινδρομικής κίνησης ΣΜΙΛΗ!
mnch019	και κοίτα...
mnch020	Είναι ένα "ΣΠΑΣΤΑ-ΟΛΑ!"
mnch021	Συνήθως δεν τα δίνουν αυτά στους νέους.
mnma022	Και πως απέκτησες ένα ΣΠΑΣΤΑ-ΟΛΑ;
mnch023	Έχω διασυνδέσεις, βύσματα...
mnch024	Και είχα και λάφυρα για να ανταλλάξω.
mnch025	Το παιχνίδι εδώ έξω στον μεγάλο ύφαλο παίζεται με ΑΝΤΑΛΛΑΓΕΣ.
mnma026	Λάφυρα; Που βρήκες τα λάφυρα;
mnch027	Είναι παντού στον πάτο του ωκεανού--κοσμήματα, πολύτιμα νομίσματα...
mnch028	Εσείς οι άνθρωποι με τα φανταχτερά ΠΛΟΙΑ σας δε μαθαίνεται ποτέ για αυτά...
mnch029	...γιατί απλά ποτέ δε σταματάτε να κοιτάξετε.
mnma030	Δωσ' μου λίγα λάφυρα και θα εξαγοράσω την απόδραση μας.
mnch031	Τα έδωσα όλα για αυτή την καλλονή!
mnma032	Αντάλλαξες κοσμήματα και πολύτιμα νομίσματα για να πάρεις ένα υπερεργαλείο κατασκευών;
mnch033	ΜΑ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΕΝΑ ΣΠΑΣΤΑ-ΟΛΑ!
mnma034	Θέλω να ανταλλάξω κάτι.
mnch035	Λοιπόν, βρίσκεσαι στο σωστό μέρος, γιε μου.
mnch036	Τι θα χρειαστείς;
mnma037	Ένα ποτό.
mnch038	Χα! Κολυμπάμε στο μεγαλύτερο ποτό που υπάρχει!
mnch039	Τα ποτά δεν είναι περιζήτητο εμπόρευμα εδώ κάτω, λυπάμαι.
mnma040	Ένα όπλο.
mnch041	Ουυυυ, αυτό θα σου κοστίσει αρκετά...
mnch042	Τι έχεις πάνω σου;
mnma043	Το δρεπάνι μου.
mnch044	Και θα ήσουν πρόθυμος να το αποχωριστείς;
mnma045	Εμ... όχι.
mnma046	Το ζιβάγκο μου.
mnch047	Ω ναι, αυτό είναι όμορφο.
mnch048	Ακρυλικό είναι;
mnma049	Όχι, είναι όλο φτιαγμένο από φυσικά υλικά.
mnch050	Α, κρίμα τότε. Οι φυσικές ίνες είναι πολύ άβολες στο βυθό.
mnma051	Ξέρω, ξέρω...
mnma052	Νομίζω ότι είναι ένα είδος πρασινό-μπλε πλαγκτόν.
mnch053	Α, μην ανησυχείς, θα το συνηθίσεις.
mnch054	Θα το συνηθίσεις!
mnch055	Όταν θα έχεις κάτι που αξίζει να ανταλλάξεις, έλα να δεις το γέρο-Chepito!
mnch056	Θα σου φερθεί τίμια!
mnma057	Μια αγκαλιά.
mnch058	Χμ... με τίποτα!
mnch059	Αυτό είναι το μόνο πράγμα που δεν έχω για σένα!
mnma060	Ένα πλοίο.
mnch061	ΑΝΤΕ ΠΑΛΙ ΜΕ ΤΑ ΠΛΟΙΑ!
mnch062	Αφού ξέρεις ότι τα αντιπαθώ, γιατί πρέπει να με τσιγκλάς;
mnma063	Μια πετσέτα.
mnch064	Έχεις πλάκα τελικά, με το κεφάλι-κιμωλία!
mnma065	Θέλω ο φίλος μου ο Glottis να είναι ζωντανός.
mnch066	Πως; Τι συνέβη;
mnma067	Έπεσε πέρα από την άκρη.
mnch068	Ε, σου λέω μείνε μακριά από την άκρη--είναι επικίνδυνα!
mnch069	Στον καιρό μου είχα δει ολόκληρα πλοία να χάνονται πέρα από εκεί...
mnch070	Έβαζαν την όπισθεν στις μηχανές τους με πλήρη ισχύ, προσπαθούσαν να ρίξουν άγκυρα, αλλά το ρεύμα...
mnch071	...δε μπορείς να το νικήσεις, οπότε μείνε μακριά!
mnma072	Τι λες για ένα ζευγάρι όμορφες μεταξωτές γυναικείες κάλτσες;
mnch073	Α, να ένα υψηλής τάξης αντικείμενο!
mnch074	ΙΣΩΣ να μπορώ να σου βρω ένα, αλλά πρέπει να σε προειδοποιήσω...
mnch075	...δε θα μπορούσες να το πληρώσεις!
mnma076	Απλά δώσε μου λίγο χρόνο να το σκεφτώ παραπάνω.
mnch077	Χρόνο! Χε χε. Αυτό είναι το μόνο πράγμα που μπορώ να σου δώσω δωρεάν!  Χα, Χα, χε, χι!
mnch078	Χε, χε!
mnma079	Εμ, δε μπορώ να σκεφτώ κάτι άλλο!
mnch080	Σκέψου κάτι σε μικρή κλίμακα, όπως ένα μαχαίρι ή πονηρά βιβλία...
mnma081	Έχεις τέτοια πράγματα;
mnch082	Τώρα που το λες, όχι, αλλά πρακτικά έχω ΟΤΙΔΗΠΟΤΕ άλλο.
mnma083	Αυτό το εργαλείο μοιάζει κάπως πολύ ισχυρό για τα μέτρα σου.
mnch084	Πολύ ισχυρό;! 
mnch085	Τίποτα δεν υπερισχύει του Chepito!
mnma086	Για να το λες εσύ, κάτι θα ξέρεις.
mnma087	Λοιπόν, μάλλον δε θα 'θελες να σε πιάσει εκείνο το μεγάλο χταπόδι να κουβεντιάζεις.
mnch088	Ωχ, αδελφέ! Έχεις δίκιο!
mnch089	Ναι, με περιμένει μια μεγάλη μέρα από υφαλο-σπασίματα οπότε...

vdma049	Δε θα μπορούσα να τα βγάλω, είναι πάνω σε κάποιο είδος γερής μπάρας.
vdma050	Μείνε!
vdma051	Ουχ, Μισώ αυτόν τον ήχο!

vdma054	Αυτή είναι η πόρτα του γραφείου της Meche.
vdma055	Δε ξέρω τι βρίσκεται εκεί κάτω...
armc001	Κύριε, έχετε κάποιο ραντεβού;
arma002	Θα μπω εκεί μέσα να πω τα αιτήματα μου στον Domino.
armc003	Νομίζω ότι δεν κατανοείς πλήρως την ιεραρχία της εξουσίας εδώ πέρα...
armc004	Ο Pugsy και η Bibi δουλεύουν για εσένα...
armc005	Εσύ και εγώ δουλεύουμε για τον Domino, ο οποίος δουλεύει για τον Hector LeMans, τον εγκέφαλο του εγκλήματος του El Marrow.
arma006	Ε λοιπόν, νομίζω ότι ήρθε η ώρα για μια μικρή ανακατάταξη στην εταιρεία.
armc007	Ω, κοιτάξτε, Είναι ο Πρίγκιπας των Ονείρων μου!
armc008	Επέστρεψες μόνο για να με προσβάλεις και άλλο, ή απλά χρειάζεσαι πάγο για το κεφάλι σου;
artx009	pair of stockings
arma010	Ξέρεις, με λίγο διάφανο βερνίκι για τα νύχια αυτά θα φτιάξουν μια χαρά...
arma011	Δε θα τα φορούσα ποτέ αυτά!
arma012	Έχουν μια τρύπα!
arma013	Αυτά είναι πολύ ωραία για να τα χαραμίσω έτσι.
artx014	books
arma015	Παιδικά βιβλία.
armc016	Μου αρέσει να διαβάζω στους Angelitos.
armc017	Μου θυμίζει περασμένες καλύτερες εποχές.
arma018	Τα παιδιά μάλλον θα προτιμούσαν να ακούνε μόνο την Meche να τους διαβάζει αυτά τα βιβλία, όπως και να έχει.
artx019	Meche
arma020	Μου αρέσει το νέο φόρεμα.
armc021	Ε χμ, είναι το καλύτερο που μπορούσα να φτιάξω εδώ πέρα.
armc022	Έχεις ιδέα πόσο δύσκολο είναι να βρεις αξιοπρεπές ύφασμα και μεταξωτές κάλτσες...
armc023	...σε ένα εγκαταλειμμένο βιομηχανικό νησί στην άκρη του κόσμου;
arma024	Χμμμ...
arma025	Όχι. Όχι, δεν έχω την παραμικρή ιδέα.
arma026	Δε νομίζω ότι έχει κέφια για κάτι τέτοιο αυτή τη στιγμή.
arma027	Αυτή η χειρονομία μάλλον θα την μπερδέψει.
arma028	Είμαι σε σύγχυση.
arma029	Όσο απειλητικό και αν είναι το μικρό σφυράκι μου...
arma030	...δε νομίζω ότι θα το μετρήσει ως όπλο.
arma031	Χμ... δεύτερη επέτειος...
arma032	Δε μπορώ να θυμηθώ αν είναι "βαμβάκι" ή "πορσελάνη," αλλά σίγουρα δεν είναι "σιδηρικά."
arma033	Μάλλον θα δοκιμάσω πρώτα ένα σύμβουλο ζευγαριών.
arma034	Μα καταρχάς έτσι ξεκίνησε όλο αυτό το μπέρδεμα!
artx035	ash tray
arma036	Φίλε μου, αυτό το σταχτοδοχείο είναι τόσο κομψό που θα μπορούσες να φας χαβιάρι από μέσα του!
armc037	Και μόλις συνηθίσεις στην γεύση της καπνιάς που θα σου μένει, θα αισθανθείς βασιλιάς!
arma038	Τα μόνα τασάκια που κλέβω είναι από μπαρ.
armc039	Πρόσεχε! Αυτό το πράγμα αξίζει περισσότερο και από τους δυο μας.
armc040	Αχ! Ω!
armc041	Ωχ, οι κάλτσες μου! Καταστράφηκαν!
armc042	Και αυτό ήταν το καλύτερο ζευγάρι που είχα...
armc043	Εκεί που προσπαθείς να έχεις απλά ένα όμορφο πράγμα σε αυτό το βάναυσο νησί...
artx044	wastebasket
arma045	Μια χαρά είναι.
armc046	Ποια;
arma047	Ω, ε... η...εμ...
arma048	...η ταχύτητα με την οποία εργάζεσαι.
armc049	Πολύ ωραία, Manny, αλλά δεν είσαι το αφεντικό μου, οπότε ειλικρινά δε δίνω δεκάρα.
arma050	Καλώς. ’ριστα. Συνέχισε.
armc051	Το είδος της δουλειάς μας δεν παράγει πολύ γραφειοκρατία.
artx052	door
arma053	Αυτή είναι η πόρτα προς το διάδρομο.
artx054	door
arma055	Αυτή είναι η πόρτα προς το νέο γραφείο του Domino.
arma056	Αναρωτιέμαι που οδηγεί αυτή η πόρτα...
arma057	Έϊ, σχετικά με το όπλο που λέγαμε...
armc058	Μπα, είσαι έτοιμος να μου παραδώσεις το σιδηρικό σου;
arma059	Θα ήμουν αν είχα ένα.
armc060	Μάλιστα.
arma061	Βρήκα ένα σκάφος!
armc062	Πως; Μήπως τράβηξες ένα εσωτερικό θάλαμο από τα μεγάλα γρανάζια του γερανού;
arma063	Όχι, ο Glottis προσγειώθηκε σε ένα μεγάλο πλοίο όταν πήγε πέρα από την άκρη.
armc064	Ο Glottis είναι ζωντανός;
arma065	Ναι, αυτός--
arma066	Εσωτερικό θάλαμο;
arma067	Γιατί δεν το σκέφτηκα εγώ αυτό!; 
arma068	Έλα μαζί μου, φεύγουμε από εδώ.
armc069	Πάλι προσπαθείς να κλέψεις την προμήθεια μου από τον Domino;
armc070	Manny, δεν τα παρατάς ποτέ;
arma071	Δεν κυνηγάω καμιά προμήθεια. Θέλω μόνο να μας βγάλω από εδώ.
armc072	Τότε γιατί δεν ζητάς απλά από το αφεντικό σου να πάρεις μια μέρα άδεια; 
arma073	Δε μπορώ να πιστέψω ότι νομίζεις πως είναι το αφεντικό μου. Είναι ο μεγάλος εχθρός μου!
armc074	Εγώ νομίζω ότι είναι το αφεντικό σου, εσύ νομίζεις ότι είναι ο φίλος μου...
armc075	...Δε φαίνεται να έχουμε γερά θεμέλια εμπιστοσύνης στη σχέση μας, τι λες και εσύ;
arma076	Συγγνώμη που υπονόησα ότι είχατε σχέσεις. Αλήθεια σε εμπιστεύομαι.
armc077	Λοιπόν, εγώ δεν είμαι τόσο σίγουρη ότι σε εμπιστεύομαι σχετικά με αυτό.
armc078	Αλλά θα σου πω ένα πράγμα που θα μπορούσε να με πείσει.
arma079	Ακούω.
armc080	Δώσε μου το όπλο σου.
arma081	Δε μου έδωσαν όπλο!
armc082	Γιατί, είσαι έξω με αναστολή;
armc083	Δεν τα χάφτω αυτά, Manuel.
arma084	ΔΕΝ ΔΟΥΛΕΥΩ ΓΙΑ ΤΗΝ ΠΙΟ ΒΑΡΙΑ-ΟΠΛΙΣΜΕΝΗ ΟΡΓΑΝΩΣΗ ΠΟΥΘΕΝΑ!
armc085	Λοιπόν ξέρεις κάτι, έχεις δίκιο.
armc086	Υπάρχουν κάποιες φήμες για εκείνον τον επαναστατικό στρατό που λένε ότι εδώ και καιρό στοιβάζει όπλα.
arma087	Η αλήθεια είναι ότι για ΑΥΤΟΥΣ δουλεύω, ναι.
armc088	Manny, γιατί δεν ξανασυζητάμε όταν θα είσαι έτοιμος να λογαριαστείς στα ίσα μαζί μου, ε;
arma089	Τι; Τι σε κάνει να πιστεύεις ότι κουβαλάω όπλο;
armc090	Εργάζεσαι για την πιο βαριά-οπλισμένη οργάνωση στη Χώρα των Νεκρών.
armc091	Ούτε να το σκεφτείς να ισχυριστείς ότι δε σου δώσανε ένα όπλο.
arma092	Όχι, δεν πρόκειται.
armc093	Το περίμενα.
arma094	Βεβαίως. Να το.
arma095	Εντάξει, κοίταξε, το πρόβλημα είναι ότι απλά δεν έχω ένα.
armc096	Ω, ΚΑΝΕ ΜΟΥ ΤΗ ΧΑΡΗ, Manuel!
arma097	Νομίζω ότι πρέπει να μιλήσουμε.
armc098	Ξεκίνα να μιλάς. Εσύ είσαι ο πωλητής.
arma099	Σου χρωστάω μια εξήγηση.
armc100	Μην κουράζεσαι...
armc101	Ο Domino ήδη μου τα εξήγησε όλα.
arma102	Εσύ μου χρωστάς πολλές εξηγήσεις.
armc103	Τι-- ΕΓΩ;
armc104	Σχετικά με τι;
arma105	Εξακολουθείς να μου χρωστάς μερικές εξηγήσεις.
armc106	Και ξαναρωτώ, σχετικά με τι;
arma107	Γιατί με έριξες αναίσθητο με εκείνο το μπουκάλι σαμπάνιας;
armc108	Μα σου εξήγησα--για να σε αποτρέψω από το να πέσεις κατευθείαν στην παγίδα του Domino.
armc109	Αν προλάβαινες εκείνο το πλοίο τότε θα κατέληγες...
arma110	Εδώ;
armc111	Ναι.
arma112	Γιατί δουλεύεις για τον Domino;
armc113	Κάνω ό,τι μου ζητάει μόνο και μόνο για να προστατέψω τα παιδιά.
arma114	Γιατί είναι τα παιδιά κλειδωμένα σε κλουβί;
armc115	Με τα φτερά που έχουν αυτά τα Angelitos, είναι τα μοναδικά πράγματα σε αυτό το νησί που ο Domino δεν μπορεί να ελέγξει.
arma116	Έϊ, αφού μπορούν να πετάξουν, εγώ λέω να τα ελευθερώσουμε και να τα στείλουμε να φέρουν βοήθεια!
armc117	Δεν μπορούν να πετάξουν ΤΟΣΟ μακριά, Manny.
armc118	Αλλά μπορούν να πετάξουν κυκλωτικά γύρω από τον Domino, και μπορούν να δαγκώσουν αρκετά δυνατά...
armc119	Χι χι...
arma120	Λοιπόν γιατί έφυγες βιαστικά από το γραφείο μου;
armc121	Αισθάνθηκα τρομερή ντροπή, και εσύ έδειχνες τόσο απογοητευμένος για μένα, που δεν μπορούσα να το αντέξω άλλο.
arma122	Και τότε τι έκανες ένα ολόκληρο χρόνο όσο εγώ ήμουν στην Rubacava;
armc123	Είχα χαθεί.
arma124	Δηλαδή τι έκανες--
armc125	Σε παρακαλώ, δε θέλω να μιλάω για εκείνο το χρόνο.
arma126	Ο Domino σου έκανε κακό με κάποιο τρόπο;
armc127	Όχι τόσο κακό όσο εγώ του προκάλεσα.
armc128	Φίλε μου, αυτός ο τύπος ξέρει να δέχεται μπουνιές!
arma129	Εντάξει, θα σταματήσω την ανάκριση.
armc130	Τέλεια, τώρα μας μένει να σε πείσουμε να σταματήσεις και την κολόνια.
arma131	Έϊ, τώρα είμαι ναύτης. Πρέπει να φοράμε αυτό το κατασκεύασμα.
arma132	Πάω να κοιτάξω να μας βρω κανένα πλοίο.
armc133	Ω, θυμήσου να βρεις μια γρήγορη για να μπορούμε να κάνουμε θαλάσσιο-σκι, εντάξει;
arma134	Λοιπόν, πρέπει να πάω να ελέγξω τι συμβαίνει με το πλοίο.
armc135	Δώσε χαιρετίσματα στον Glottis από μένα.
arma136	’κου, Meche...
armc137	Manny, η συζήτηση δε βοηθάει αυτή τη στιγμή, ντάξει;
drdo071	Κρύψε σε παρακαλέσω αυτό--
drdo072	...αυτό...
drdo073	Χα χα χα!
drdo074	Εντάξει, μπορείς να κρατάς το μικρό σφυράκι αν το επιθυμείς.
drdo075	Κρύψ'το αυτό σε παρακαλώ.
drdo076	Και αυτό.
drdo077	Σε ευχαριστώ.
drtx078	Domino
drma079	Μοιάζει να αγνοεί εντελώς το πόσο κοντά πλησιάζω στο να δραπετεύσω!
drma080	Όχι, δε νομίζω ότι θα αντέξω το γέλιο του για δεύτερη φορά.
drma081	Μπα. δε με παίρνει να κάνω κάτι τέτοιο.
drtx082	door
drma001	Δεν έχω τίποτα να του πω.
drma002	Domino.
drma003	DOMINO!
drdo004	Κάνεις το πρώτο διάλλειμα για καφέ τόσο νωρίς Calavera;
drma005	Έχουμε ένα παλιό λογαριασμό να ρυθμίσουμε, ese.
drdo006	(Ουφ) Ξέρεις, αν εγώ μιλούσα στο αφεντικό μου τον Hector με αυτό τον τρόπο...
drdo007	Έϊ, φιλαράκο. Πως πάει η...εμ...απόδραση;
drma008	Τι της έκανες;
drdo009	Θεώρησα ότι χρειαζόταν λίγες...εμ..."διακοπές", αυτό είναι όλο...
drma010	Εντάξει. Ήρθε η ώρα να βγάλεις την Meche έξω από το χρηματοκιβώτιο.
drdo011	Ω, συνήθως πρέπει να την αφήσω εκεί μέσα να περάσει την νύχτα για να της περάσουν ΠΡΑΓΜΑΤΙΚΑ τα νεύρα.
drma012	Νομίζεις ότι θα της σπάσεις το ηθικό απλά κλείνοντας την εκεί για όλη τη νύχτα;
drdo013	Όχι, αλλά η έλλειψη φρέσκου οξυγόνου επιβραδύνει τις αντιδράσεις της αρκετά, ώστε να μπορέσω να ανοίξω την πόρτα...
drdo014	...χωρίς να φοβάμαι.
drma015	Σκότωσες τον καλύτερο μου φίλο.
drdo016	Το δαιμόνιο;
drdo017	(Ουφ) Manny, μπορείς να χρησιμοποιείς ένα δαιμόνιο ως οδηγό σου, να του αναθέτεις να παίρνει τα μηνύματα σου, να τον αφήνεις να σου σερβίρει φαγητό...
drdo018	...αλλά ποτέ δεν πρέπει να αρχίσεις να τους βλέπεις ως φίλους, απλά δεν είναι φυσιολογικό.
drma019	Τι κάνεις εδώ έξω στην άκρη του κόσμου;
drdo020	Ω, ξέρω. Και εγώ το ίδιο ρωτάω τον εαυτό μου κάθε μέρα.
drdo021	Αλλά θα σε εκπαιδεύσω, Manny, να αναλάβεις τη θέση μου εδώ, ως διευθυντής αυτού του διμερούς εργοστασίου για λαμπτήρες.
drma022	Πως μπορείς να κρατάς μικρά παιδιά κλεισμένα σε ένα κλουβί;
drdo023	Πίστεψε με, είναι πιο εύκολο από το να κρατάς ΜΕΓΑΛΑ παιδιά κλεισμένα σε κλουβί.
drma024	Γιατί δεν με "ανθίζεις" όπως προσπάθησες να κάνεις στο Puerto Zapato;
drdo025	Δεν ήμουν εγώ τότε, ήταν ο Hector.
drdo026	Δεν έχει πολύ φαντασία αυτός, απλά θέλει να κλείνει τις ανοιχτές υποχρεώσεις, καταλαβαίνεις;
drdo027	Αλλά εγώ είμαι της άποψης, ωστόσο, ότι μπορείς να αναμορφωθείς πιάνοντας μια τίμια δουλειά!
drma028	Τι σε κάνει να πιστεύεις ότι θα δουλέψω για σένα;
drdo029	Ε λοιπόν, δεν υπάρχουν και πολλά να κάνεις σε αυτό το νησί αν δε δουλεύεις, άκου με που σου λέω!
drdo030	Και επιπλέον σκέψου το--μόλις φύγω, θα είσαι μόνος σου με τη Meche σε αυτό το έρημο νησί...
drdo031	Μη μου πεις ότι αυτή η προοπτική δε σε δελεάζει.
drma032	Δε σχεδιάζω να μείνω σε αυτό το νησί για πολύ ακόμα.
drdo033	Manny, εγώ έχω όλα τα όλα, ελέγχω όλα τα μέσα συγκοινωνίας...
drdo034	...και έχω όλη την εξυπνάδα.
drdo035	Τι μπορείς να κάνεις εσύ καημένε;
drma036	Εσύ και ο Hector στήσατε μια μυστική γιάφκα για να κατασκευάζετε λαμπτήρες;
drdo037	Ω, όχι, αυτό είναι μόνο ένα παράπλευρο όφελος.
drdo038	Ο πραγματικός σκοπός είναι να έχουμε ένα μέρος όπου θα κλειδώνουμε όλους αυτούς τους παλιούς πελάτες μου.
drdo039	Δε μπορούμε να αφήσουμε καλούς ανθρώπους να περιφέρονται ξαμολημένοι στη Χώρα των Νεκρών...
drdo040	...και να διηγούνται στον κάθε ένα πως τους κλέψαμε τα A-E εισιτήρια, ε μπορούμε;
drma041	Κλέψατε τα εισιτήρια από όλους αυτούς τους ανθρώπους;
drdo042	Α καλά, πόσα ακριβώς από την υπόθεση δεν έχεις ακόμα καταλάβει, Calavera;
drdo043	Ο Copal δρομολογούσε όλους τους καλούς πελάτες σε εμένα αφού πρώτα μετέφερε τα εισιτήρια τους σε ένα μυστικό μετοχικό απόθεμα...
drdo044	Εγώ κάλυπτα τις αποδείξεις, και μετά εξασφαλίζαμε ότι το περιστεράκι θα "πηδούσε στη θάλασσα" χε χε, στο Μαργαριτάρι.
drma045	Το ήξερα! ΟΝΤΩΣ εσύ έπαιρνες όλους τους καλούς πελάτες!
drdo046	Όλους τους χειρίστηκα, εκτός από τη Mercedes, που μου έκλεψες μέσα από τα χέρια μου με εκείνο το γελοίο τροποποιημένο αυτοκίνητο...
drdo047	Το οποίο το πήρε το μάτι μου, παρεπιπτόντως, την τελευταία φορά που ήμουν στην Rubacava.
drdo048	Στο λέω Manny, τέτοια "πουσαρισμένα" αυτοκίνητα δεν τα θεωρώ πολύ ασφαλή...
drma049	’ρα, δεν ήταν από δικό φταίξιμο που η Meche δεν πήρε εισιτήριο--εσύ το έκλεψες!
drdo050	Ναι αλλά είναι δικό σου το φταίξιμο που αυτή κατάληξε στο δάσος, αντί να έρθει αμέσως εδώ...
drdo051	Μα εγώ το διόρθωσα αυτό.
drma052	Θα βγάλω την Meche από αυτό το μπουντρούμι.
drdo053	Manny, πριν την βρω εγώ, είχε περάσει ένα χρόνο εκεί έξω στο Απολιθωμένο Δάσος μόνη της εξαιτίας σου...
drdo054	Συγκριτικά, θα έλεγα ότι της παρέχω μια αρκετά άνετη ζωή εδώ στο, εχ, "μπουντρούμι" μου, τι λες και εσύ;
drma055	Ένα εισιτήριο για εσένα, ένα για τον Hector, πόσα παραπάνω χρειάζεστε;
drdo056	Ω, Manny, εμείς ποτέ δεν αγγίζουμε το εμπόρευμα οι ίδιοι!
drdo057	Πουλάμε το εισιτήριο σε άτυχες ψυχές...
drdo058	...που ήταν ανίκανες να οδηγηθούν από ηθικές αξίες στη ζωή τους εξαιτίας του πενιχρού ποσού χρημάτων με τα οποία γεννήθηκαν.
drma059	Μα θα μπορούσατε να πάρετε τα εισιτήρια και να φύγετε σήμερα κιόλας!
drdo060	Βρήκαμε επιτέλους ένα τρόπο να κάνουμε τη Χώρα των Νεκρών ΒΙΩΣΙΜΗ, γιατί να θέλουμε να φύγουμε τώρα;
drma061	Ωραίο νησάκι έχετε εδώ.
drdo062	Ναι, οι προηγούμενοι ιδιοκτήτες δεν ήξεραν τι είχαν στα χέρια τους--μας το άφησαν για ψίχουλα.
drdo063	Φτυάρισαν όλο το κοράλλι που έφτανε ο γερανός τους, και μετά εγκατέλειψαν το εργοστάσιο!
drdo064	Αλλά εμείς γνωρίζαμε ότι είχαμε τα προσόντα να διανύσουμε την πρόσθετη απόσταση μέχρι το Μεγάλο Ύφαλο.
drma065	Πάλι θα αρχίσεις το κήρυγμα για την ψυχολογία του νικητή;
drdo066	Όχι!
drdo067	Εργατικά χέρια σκλάβων, Manny!
drdo068	Αυτό είναι το πραγματικό εισιτήριο για την επιτυχία!
drma069	Λοιπόν, λέω να επιστρέψω στις απόπειρες μου να δραπετεύσω.
drdo070	Χα χα χα. Έϊ, αυτό να κάνεις μικρέ.

fobi004	Αυτός ήταν ο λόγος που αποφάσισαν να μας κλείσουνε στο κλουβί!
fopu005	Γεια σου κύριε Μοχθηρό Αφεντικό.
foma006	Πως τα πάνε οι γενναίοι μικροί μου στρατιώτες;
fobi007	Ήρθες για να μας σώσεις;
foma008	Με αυτό ασχολούμαι.
foma009	Αλλαγή σχεδίου. Η Meche είναι κλειδωμένη για τα καλά. Θα φύγουμε χωρίς αυτήν.
fobi010	Δεν μπορούμε να φύγουμε χωρίς την Meche!
fopu011	Δεν μπορούμε να φύγουμε χωρίς την Meche!
foma012	Έϊ! Δε θέλω ούτε καβγάδες, ούτε δαγκωνιές!
fobi013	Αυτός το άρχισε.
fopu014	Αυτή άρχισε πρώτη.
fobi015	Όχι εγώ.
fopu016	Ούτε εγώ.
fobi017	Εσύ βέβαια.
fopu018	Εσύ ήσουν.
foma019	Μη με κάνετε να έρθω εκεί μέσα!
foma020	Έϊ, μήπως τυχαίνει κάποιο παιδάκι από εσάς να έχει ένα όπλο;
fopu021	Ναι, έχουμε.
fopu022	Γι'αυτό ψηλά τα χέρια!
foma023	Για δείξ'το μου.
fobi024	(Δεν έχει όπλο. Είναι μεγάλος ψεύτης.)
foma025	Έϊ, έϊ. Μη κλαίτε παιδάκια....
foma026	Σας παρακαλώ...
foma027	...σταματήστε τα κλάματα...
foma028	Γιατί είμαι τόσο χάλια με αυτά τα πράγματα;
foma029	Γιατί θέλετε να με δαγκώσετε;
fopu030	Είσαι το μοχθηρό νέο αφεντικό.
fobi031	ο κύριος Hurley είπε ότι είσαι πιο αυστηρός από εκείνον!
fopu032	Είπε ότι έχεις ένα ΠΡΙΟΝΙ ΟΣΤΩΝ.
foma033	Το όνομα μου είναι Manny Calavera. Εσάς πως σας λένε;
fopu034	Ο κύριος Hurley μας μίλησε για σένα.
fopu035	Εσύ είσαι αυτός που ξεγέλασε την Meche.
fobi036	Καημένη Meche...
foma037	Δεν ξεγέλασα κανένα.
fopu038	Ο κύριος Hurley είπε ότι αυτός θα έπρεπε να περιποιηθεί την Meche, αλλά εσύ πήγες και έκλεψες την υπόθεση της από αυτόν.
fobi039	Είναι αλήθεια αυτό;
foma040	Για να δω πως μπορώ να σας εξηγήσω όλη την κατάσταση.
foma041	Βλέπεται, εγώ είχα αυτή τη δουλειά, να πουλάω ταξιδιωτικά πακέτα σε ψυχές που μεταναστεύουν...
foma042	Αν κατάφερνα να πουλήσω αρκετά από αυτά, θα μπορούσα να φύγω από τη Χώρα των Νεκρών.
foma043	Αλλά, έπεσα σε αναδουλειές, και χρειαζόμουν μια πραγματικά πλούσια προμήθεια, οπότε--
fobi044	Είσαι κακός άνθρωπος!
fopu045	Ουστ από εδώ κακέ άνθρωπε!
fobi046	Ναι, φύγε από εδώ!
foma047	Η Meche είναι φίλη μου. Μπορείτε να ρωτήσετε και την ίδια.
fopu048	Μας ήδη έχει μιλήσει για σένα.
fobi049	Κάθε φορά που λέει το όνομα σου, δείχνει τόσο λυπημένη.
fopu050	Δε ξέρω τι της έκανες, αλλά θα το μετανιώσεις!
foma051	Τι κάνετε τα δυο σας σε αυτό το κλουβί;
fobi052	Φτιάχνουμε λαμπτήρες.
fopu053	Κοίτα, δουλεύουμε όσο πιο σκληρά μπορούμε!
fopu054	Γιατί δε μας αφήνεις ήσυχους;
foma055	Ακούστε, παιδάκια. Εγώ είμαι εδώ για να σας βοηθήσω.
fobi056	Δεν υπάρχει αρκετός χώρος για άλλον εδώ μέσα...
fopu057	Και οι χερούκλες σου είναι πολύ μεγάλες για να φτιάξεις λαμπτήρες!
foma058	Είμαι εδώ για να σας βοηθήσω να βγείτε έξω από αυτό το κλουβί.
fopu059	Δε μπορείς να το κάνεις αυτό!
fopu060	Πρέπει να μείνουμε εδώ και να φροντίζουμε την Meche!
fobi061	Θα είναι τόσο λυπημένη αν μείνει μόνη της εδώ.
fobi062	Είναι φορές που την ακούμε να κλαίει, ξέρεις.
foma063	Τα χέρια μου δεν είναι τόσο μεγάλα, ώστε να μην μπορώ να φτιάξω λαμπτήρες.
fopu064	Τότε γιατί ΔΕΝ μας βοηθάς;
foma065	Ξέρετε, εγώ πραγματικά θέλω να βοηθήσω.
foma066	Τώρα που το ξανασκέφτομαι, ίσως και να μη θέλω.
fopu067	Τότε γιατί δεν το κάνεις;
foma068	Ο κώλος μου είναι πολύ μεγάλος για να καθίσω σε μία από αυτές τις θέσεις.
fobi069	Αχχμ! Θα το πω στη Meche πως μας είπες αυτή τη λέξη.
fopu070	Στο είχα πει ότι είναι κακός.
foma071	Απλά δεν έχω κανένα από αυτά τα υπερβολικά μικροσκοπικά εργαλεία, αυτό είναι όλο.
fopu072	Να, πάρε το δικό μου σφυράκι.

foma079	Ανήκω στο ναυτιλιακό σωματείο. Δε μπορούμε να κάνουμε εργοστασιακή δουλειά.
fobi080	Μα δεν ξέρω καν τι σημαίνουν αυτές οι λέξεις.
fopu081	Πάει να πει πως δε θέλει να μας βοηθήσει γιατί είναι ΚΑΚΟΣ.
foma082	Ίσως απλά να μη θέλω.
fobi083	Ούτε και εμείς θέλουμε.
fobi084	Αλλά δεν έχουμε άλλη επιλογή.
foma085	Είστε δύο κακά παιδάκια. Χαίρομαι που είστε σε κλουβί.
fobi086	Χι-χι, χι-χι...
fopu087	Χα χα χα, χα...
foma088	ΠΟΛΥ κακά.
fobi089	ΧΙ ΧΙ ΧΙ ΧΙ-ΧΙ!
fopu090	Α-ΧΑ-ΧΑ-ΧΑ-Α!
foma091	Εγώ είμαι αυτός που θα βγάλει τη Meche από εδώ.
fobi092	Τι;
fopu093	Δε μπορείς να το κάνεις αυτό!
fobi094	Και ποιός θα μας φροντίζει εμάς;
fobi095	Ωχού! Θα μείνουμε ολομόναχοι!
foma096	Θα σώσω και εσάς! Και την Meche, και όλους!
fopu097	Η MECHE θα μας σώσει.
fobi098	Μας είπε ότι θα μας πάει στη Χώρα των Αηδονιών και των Πεταλούδων.
fopu099	Και θα ζήσουμε μαζί σε ένα μεγάλο δέντρο.
fobi100	Και το δένδρο θα μας προστατεύει και θα μας δίνει φαγητό και θα μας φροντίζει.
foma101	Ε λοιπόν... αυτό είναι αλήθεια, θα το κάνει.
foma102	Αλλά και εγώ θα βοηθήσω, εντάξει;
foma103	Αν τολμήσετε να με δαγκώσετε, θα μηνύσω τους γονείς σας.
fobi104	Τους γονείς μας;
fopu105	Τους γονείς μας;
foma106	Ωραίο κλουβί έχετε εδώ πέρα.
fopu107	Ο κύριος Hurley μεγάλωνε δαιμονικά κοράκια με ανθρώπινα κεφάλια εδώ μέσα.
fobi108	Είπε πως αν ποτέ προσπαθούσαμε να ξεφύγουμε, θα έστελνε τα κοράκια πίσω μας.
fopu109	...και θα τα άφηνε να φτιάξουν φωλιές με τα κόκαλά μας.
foma110	Εντάξει, πίσω στις δουλειές σας!
fopu111	Τι κακός...
foma112	Παιδάκια, θα περιμένετε εδώ και θα είστε γενναία μικρά angelitos, εντάξει;
fobi113	Εντάξει.

vimc003	Όχι για μένα. Ξεχνάς ότι εμείς δεν επιπλέουμε;
vimc004	Ωχ, όχι πάλι!
vimc005	Σ' ευχαριστώ.
vimc006	Έϊ, αυτό είναι το ΔΙΚΟ ΜΟΥ δωμάτιο!
vimc007	Τράβα να καταναλώσεις τον αέρα στο δικό σου δωμάτιο!
vima008	Σε ευχαριστώ που δεν με πυροβόλησες.
vimc009	Κοίτα, συγγνώμη...
vimc010	Θα έπρεπε να σου έχω εμπιστοσύνη, απλά όμως...
vimc011	Τα δυο χρόνια που πέρασαν ήταν αρκετά δύσκολα, ξέρεις.
vima012	Τι έχεις μέσα σε αυτές τις βαλίτσες;
vimc013	Ρίξε μια ματιά.
vimc014	Είναι όλα τα Ν-Ε εισιτήρια που ο Hector και ο Dom έχουν κλέψει όλα αυτά τα χρόνια.
vimc015	Το κάθε ένα κλεμμένο από μια καλή ψυχή, και τώρα απλά...
vimc016	...στέκονται εκεί.
vima017	Αυτό είναι!
vimc018	Τι;
vima019	Απλά στέκονται εκεί! Αυτό είναι που με ενοχλούσε τόσο καιρό!
vima020	Τον καιρό που ήμουν στα πάνω μου ως πωλητής, έβλεπα Ν-Ε εισιτήρια συνέχεια...
vima021	...και μπορούσαν να κινηθούν!
vimc022	Τι εννοείς, μπορούσαν να κινηθούν;
vima023	Όταν βρίσκονται κοντά σε ανθρώπινες ψυχές διεγείρονται, και το εισιτήριο που σου ανήκει θα πετάξει στο χέρι σου.
vima024	Αλλά αυτά τα εισιτήρια, και τα εισιτήρια στη βαλίτσα του Charlie, φαίνονται σαν να είναι...
vima025	...νεκρά.
vima026	Μετά από εσάς.
vimc027	Και τι θα κάνουμε με τις βαλίτσες;
vima028	Δεν έχει σημασία!
vima029	Ξέχνα τες, το περιεχόμενο τους είναι πλαστογραφημένο. 
vima030	Έτσι και αλλιώς δε θα χωρούσαν από αυτή την τρύπα!
vima031	Φύγαμε!

vimc040	Ωραία ατάκα, αλλά είμαστε ήδη νεκροί, το ξέχασες;
vima041	Μου φαίνεται ότι θα σου χρειαζόταν μια ωραία κρουαζιέρα στον ωκεανό!

vimc047	Δε θα είχε περισσότερο νόημα να στέκομαι εγώ στους ώμους σου, έτσι και αλλιώς;
vima048	Αστειεύεσαι; Με αυτά τα τακούνια σου!
vima049	Ούτε να τον φτάσω δεν μπορώ με αυτό.

myma005	Το'ξερα πως έπρεπε να ελέγξουμε και αυτή την πλευρά του βουνού πριν το ανέβουμε περπατώντας!

myma007	Ε, τι λέτε για μια βόλτα με γόνδολα, ξωτικά;
mym1008	Είναι πολύ μεγάλος!
mym2009	Και η γόνδολα πάει πολύ αργά!
myma010	Σίγουρα κάποιος εδώ γύρω πληρώνεται για να τις καθαρίζει.
myma011	Δεν είμαι ο τεχνικός για τις γόνδολες.

myma014	Δε νομίζω ότι θα με αφήσουν να τον ακουμπήσω.

myma016	Ορίστε, σκουπίστε το μέτωπό του με αυτό!

mym1067	Σσσσσσ!
mym2068	Αφουγκραζόμαστε την αναπνοή του για σημάδια!
myma069	Ακούστε, η ζωή του εξαρτάται από αυτό το καύσιμο!
mym1070	Σε παρακαλούμε! Μηχανικοί είμαστε!
mym2071	Ξέρουμε τι ψάχνουμε...
mym1072	...και αυτό δεν είναι το βρωμερό, κρουστώδες υγρό που προσφέρεις σε αυτό το ποτήρι!
mym1135	Απάλλαξε μας από το θνητό σου φάρμακο!
mym1027	A, το αγαπημένο άρωμα!
mym2028	Αλλά όχι αρκετό για να τον βγάλει από την κατάθλιψή του!

mytx136	Meche
myma137	Αναρωτιέμαι αν κατηγορεί εμένα;
myma138	Meche, πρέπει να επιστρέψουμε στο El Marrow για τα εισιτήρια!
mymc139	Ω, Glottis...
mymc140	Δεν του χρειάζεται κάτι τέτοιο τώρα.
mymc141	Μάλλον θα του άρεσε να το μυρίσει αυτό.

myma075	Glottis! Λυπάμαι...
mygl076	Maaaannny...
myma077	Γιατί δεν μου είπες ότι ήσουν άρρωστος;
mygl078	Δεν μπορούσαμε να σταματήσουμε...
mygl079	...έπρεπε να σώσουμε... όλους...
myma080	Υποφέρεις πολύ, φίλε μου;
mygl081	Μόνο επειδή σε απογοήτευσα, Manny.
myma082	Τι μπορώ να σου φέρω; Υπάρχει τίποτα που θα βοηθήσει;
mygl083	Θέλω να αγωνιστώ, να πετάξω όπως...
mygl084	...το παλιό καλό καιρό, Manny, στο Bone Wagon...
myma085	Μα το Bone Wagon δε βρίσκεται εδώ, carnal!
mygl086	Ίσως το ξαναδώ... στην άλλη όχθη...
myma101	Σε παρακαλώ μη πεθάνεις, Glottis!
mygl102	Η Χώρα φωνάζει πίσω τα παιδιά της, Manny...
mygl103	Ποιος είμαι εγώ να αρνηθώ;
myma087	Δε γίνεται να φτιάξουμε ένα νέο γρήγορο αμάξι;
mygl088	Πάνε εκείνες οι μέρες, Manny, τέρμα τα γρήγορα αμάξ--
mygl089	Έϊ, τι είναι εκείνο το κόκκινο πράγμα;
myma090	Η γόνδολα;
mygl091	Χμμμ... ωραία επίστρωση του έχουν κάνει...
mygl092	Ακούστε φίλοι μου, κάποιος...
mygl093	...ας μου φέρει κάποιος ένα στυλό!
mygl094	Να το έτοιμο, το τελευταίο μου έργο...
mygl095	Θα μπορούσε να με σώσει, αν βρεις το σωστό...

mygl097	...το σωστό...

mygl099	...καύσιμο...
myma100	Τι καύσιμο, Glottis;
myma148	Glottis!
myma104	Τι του συμβαίνει;
mym1105	Δεν γνωρίζεις το μοναδικό σκοπό, το μοναδικό ταλέντο, τη μοναδική επιθυμία αυτού του ευγενικού πνεύματος;
myma106	Ναι, αλλά ήμαστε τόσο μακριά από αυτοκίνητα και τον πολιτισμό για τόσο καιρό...
mym1107	Γιατί;
mym2108	Για ποιο λόγο να αφήσει το σπίτι του;
myma109	Εγώ...ε...
myma110	Κατάφερα να τον απολύσουν, και μετά...εχ...
myma111	Χρειαζόμουν έναν οδηγό...
myma112	Ω, Glottis! Τι σου έκανα;
myma113	Μπορείτε να τον θεραπεύσετε;
mym1114	Το ηθικό του έχει πέσει τόσο χαμηλά, που η κανονική οδήγηση δε θα τον γιατρέψει εγκαίρως.
mym2115	Πρέπει να πάει πιο γρήγορα...
mym1116	ΓΡΗΓΟΡΟΤΕΡΑ!
mym2117	ΓΡΗΓΟΡΟΤΕΡΑ!
myma118	Έχετε οχήματα εδώ που θα μπορούσαμε να χρησιμοποιήσουμε για να τον επαναφέρουμε;
mym1119	Μόνο τα φορτηγά που μεταφέρουν τις ψυχές...
mym2120	Αλλά πηγαίνουν αργά...
mym2121	...ΠΟΛΥ ΑΡΓΑ...
mym1122	...ΠΟΛΥ ΑΡΓΑ...
myma123	Ποιοί είστε εσείς;
mym1124	Είμαστε μηχανικοί!
mym2125	Είμαστε μηχανικοί!
mym1126	Όπως και αυτός!
mym2127	Αλλά ποτέ δεν έχουμε δει κάποιον από μας τόσο...
mym1128	...τόσο μεγάλο!
mym2129	...τόσο μεγάλο!
myma130	Πάω να δω τι μπορώ να κάνω.
mym1131	Μην αργήσεις να επιστρέψεις.
mym2132	Γιατί η ώρα του πλησιάζει...

mkma042	Υπάρχει ένα σημείωμα σε αυτή τη ψηστιέρα: "Για την αποφυγή περαιτέρω ατυχημάτων, ΠΑΡΑΚΑΛΕΙΣΤΕ...

mkma011	Δυστυχώς, δεν έχω ποτήρι για να κρεμάσω.
mkma012	Έχω ήδη ποτήρι...
mkma013	...και μάλιστα μπορώ να πω ότι είναι πολύ όμορφο.
mkma014	Το τελευταίο πράγμα που χρειάζομαι είναι ένα φτηνό διαφημιστικό ποτήρι...
mkma015	Ειδικά ένα που λέει πάνω του, "Οι Μηχανικοί για τις Γόνδολες το κάνουν Χωρίς Δίκτυα!".

jbma031	Το ζελέ είναι ακόμα σε υγρή μορφή--Δε θα σταματήσει την πτώση των ντόμινο!

jbma057	Μια παρέλαση από κόκαλα, παγιδευμένα σε μια κατάσταση αδράνειας...

jbgl061	Δεν μπορεί να στερεοποιηθεί τώρα!
jbgl062	Ζεστάθηκε ωραία ωραία στην κοιλίτσα μου.
jbma063	Εκείνα τα ντόμινο είναι σαν ένα μακρύ φυτίλι βόμβας!
jbma064	Δεν νομίζω ότι τα χέρια μου είναι αρκετά σταθερά για κάτι τέτοιο!
jbma065	Δε πατώ το πόδι μου εκεί κάτω--το παραμικρό κούνημα μπορεί να ξεκινήσει την κατρακύλα των ντόμινο!
jbma066	Μμμμμ... ωραίο φαίνεται, αλλά το προτιμώ με στόλισμα ανανά.
jbma067	Τώρα ΜΕ ΤΙΠΟΤΑ δε βάζω το χέρι μου εκεί μέσα!
jbgl068	Έϊ, καλή ιδέα...
jbgl069	Στοίχημα ότι μπορώ να το χωνέψω τώρα που κρύωσε!

jbma080	Αυτή είναι η πόρτα προς την αποβάθρα.
nqma031	Εντάξει, το σχέδιο έχει ως εξής:
nqma032	Θα πρέπει να μεταμφιεστώ ώστε να πλησιάσω τον Hector...
nqma033	...και χρειάζομαι ένα όπλο για να έχουμε κάτι να πούμε όταν θα τον συναντήσω.
nqmc034	Αν τα καταφέρεις να προετοιμαστείς, εγώ θα κοιτάξω να μάθω που βρίσκεται.
nqev035	Ο πύργος του καζίνο του είναι ακριβώς πάνω από αυτά τα κεντρικά γραφεία.
nqmc036	Έγινε, θα σε βρω εκεί!
nqev037	Προσφέρεται αμέσως για επικίνδυνες δουλειές--θα ήταν πολύ χρήσιμη για το σκοπό...
nqma038	Όπως το βλέπω εγώ πάντως...
nqma039	Αυτή ΕΙΝΑΙ ο σκοπός.
nqma040	Ποιό είναι το σπαστικό με τα άνθη;
nqev041	Αυτό το "σπαστικό" είναι το προσωπικό ξεφτέρι του Hector LeMans για τα πυρομαχικά, ο Bowlsley...
nqev042	Κωδικό όνομα "Ο Ανθοπώλης."
nqev043	Αυτή ήταν και η δουλειά του στον προηγούμενο κόσμο, αλλά εδώ ειδικεύεται στα βοτανικά όπλα...
nqev044	Η απότομη αλλαγή τον άφησε σχετικά...
nqev045	...διχασμένο.
nqma046	Φαίνεται αρκετά ευγενικός τύπος...
nqma047	Γιατί φτιάχνει το χημικό "Ανθόλη" για τον Hector και δεν είναι με το μέρος μας;
nqev048	Προσπαθούμε να τον επιστρατεύσουμε χρόνια τώρα, αλλά το εργαστήρι του είναι στον πύργο του Hector...
nqev049	Κανείς δε μπορεί να τον πλησιάσει!
nqma050	Χμμμμ...
nqma051	Πάω στοίχημα ότι αν βγάλω από εκεί αυτόν τον φυτο-πονιάρη, θα τον έπειθα να φτιάξει ένα όπλο για μένα!
nqma052	Δεν έχει τίποτα να δεις, παρά μόνο λουλούδια. 
nqma053	Αυτή η κάμερα δε δείχνει τίποτα άλλο εκτός από λουλούδια...
nqma054	--πρέπει να πρόκειται για άλλον ένα πράκτορα που έπεσε για το καθήκον.
nqma055	Και αυτή η κάμερα είναι μέσ'το λουλουδικό...
nqma056	Σύνολο τρεις απώλειες για την ΣΧΨ μέσα σε μια νύχτα!

nqma012	Έλα εδώ, μικρέ Manny!
nqma013	Αου-έϊ!
nqma014	Μάλλον είναι η μικρή Meche.
nqma015	Εντάξει τώρα, μη το δαγκώσεις, αυτό είναι ένα σημείωμα.
nqma016	Σου αρέσουν τα σημειώματα, θυμάσαι;

nqma067	Υπηρέτησες την επανάσταση, πολύ περισσότερο από ό,τι νομίζεις.
nqma068	Εγώ απλά συνεχίζω από τα έτοιμα που βρήκα!

nqma021	Πάω στοίχημα ότι ο πράκτορας σε αυτή τη φωτογραφία είναι ο κακομοίρης που μόλις πυροβόλησε ο Hector.

nqma092	Όχι μπροστά στη Meche.
nqma093	Κανένα μήνυμα για μένα;
nqev094	Όχι, δεν έχεις τηλεφωνήματα από τη μέρα που έφυγες.
nqev095	Όμως ΕΞΑΚΟΛΟΥΘΕΙ να έρχεται στο όνομα σου εκείνος ο κατάλογος για γυναικεία εσώρουχα.
nqev096	Είναι θλιβερή η σκέψη πως το σώμα του βρίσκεται ακόμα πάνω σε εκείνο το μοχθηρό πύργο...

hfma026	...για να φτάσει στην άλλη πλευρά, αθώος ακόμα, αλλά με ψυχρότερη καρδιά."
hftx027	monogram
hfma028	Πάω στοίχημα ότι ο Hector στέκεται εδώ κάθε μέρα, και μονολογεί...
hfma029	"Τι καλά που θα ήταν να μπορώ να δω πέρα από την κοιλάρα μου για να απολαύσω το ακριβό μονόγραμμά μου στο πάτωμα!"
hftx001	door
hfma030	Όχι, αφού έφτασα ως εδώ, θα μπω και μέσα.
hfma031	Celso Flores;
hfma032	Τι γυρεύεις στην αίθουσα αναμονής του Hector LeMans;
hfce033	Ω, μας άφησε εδώ έξω να αποφασίσουμε σχετικά με την προσφορά που μας έκανε...
hfce034	Και αν επιτρέπεται, ποιός είπαμε ότι είσαι εσύ;
hfma035	Λοιπόν, έτοιμοι για το ταξίδι με το μεγάλο τρένο;
hfce036	Ε χμ...
hfma037	Είμαι ο ταξιδιωτικός σου πράκτορας!
hfce038	Ω, έχω ήδη έναν ταξιδιωτικό πράκτορα.
hfce039	Αλλά βρίσκεται μίλια μακριά και σφουγγαρίζει πατώματα σε ένα εστιατόριο αυτόματου σερβιρίσματος, οπότε υποθέτω ότι η θέση είναι διαθέσιμη...
hfma040	Η αλήθεια είναι, ότι δουλεύω για τον Hector. Με έστειλε για να απαντήσω σε τυχόν απορίες σας.
hfce041	Ε--Θα το χειριστώ εγώ αυτό αγαπητή μου.
hfce042	Τι μπορείς να μου πεις σχετικά με αυτά τα "Ν-Ε" εισιτήρια;
hfce043	Η τιμή τους είναι τσουχτερή...
hfma044	Έχετε άλλες ερωτήσεις με τις οποίες μπορώ να σας βοηθήσω;
hfce045	Ακόμα μας προβληματίζει αρκετά η τιμή των εισιτηρίων...
hfma046	Είναι απάτη. Τα εισιτήρια είναι πλαστά. Πάρτε τα λεφτουδάκια σας και τρέξτε.
hfce047	Χο χο χο!
hfce048	Δε την πατάω με αυτή την πονηρή "αντίστροφη ψυχολογία", φίλε μου!
hfma049	Λοιπόν, ΔΙΝΕΙΣ λεφτά με το τσουβάλι, αλλά ΓΛΙΤΩΝΕΙΣ άλλο ένα τσουβάλι.
hfce050	Και εγώ δεν ΕΧΩ τσουβάλι, οπότε σκοτίστηκα!
hfma051	Το βασικό ερώτημα είναι, δεν νομίζεις ότι το αξίζετε;
hfce052	Το ξέρω ότι ΕΜΕΙΣ το αξίζουμε, αλλά τα ΕΙΣΙΤΗΡΙΑ το αξίζουν;
hfma053	Μα γιατί ακριβώς κρατάτε τα χρήματα σας; Για τις δύσκολες μέρες;
hfma054	Γιατί επιτρέψτε μου--Είστε νεκροί.
hfma055	Κάθε μέρα είναι δύσκολη από εδώ και πέρα.
hfce056	Ναι, αλλά αυτός δεν είναι λόγος να μην είσαι προσεκτικός με τα χρήματά σου!
hfma057	Εντάξει, αρκετά μιλήσαμε για εσάς, ακούστε και τα δικά μου προβλήματα.
hfce058	’κου έχουμε αρκετά πράγματα που θέλουμε να συζητήσουμε οπότε...
hfma059	Αυτό το μέηκ απ μου βουλώνει τους πόρους λες και φοράω βουλκανισμένο λάστιχο!
hfce060	Μπορεί, αλλά αναδεικνύει το θεληματικό πηγούνι σου.
hfma061	Αυτό το κουστούμι δε με αφήνει τα σηκώσω ψηλά τα χέρια μου!
hfce062	Τότε, ας ελπίσουμε ότι δε θα σε απειλήσει κανείς με όπλο απόψε, ε;
hfma063	Μόλις επέστρεψα από τις χειρότερες διακοπές που έκανα ποτέ μου!
hfce064	Και εγώ, μόλις επέστρεψα από μια τρομερή περιπέτεια, οπότε...
hfma065	Λοιπόν, σίγουρα θα είδες ιπτάμενες αράχνες και πύρινους κάστορες, αλλά πίστεψε με, παρακάτω είναι χειρότερα!
hfma066	Βλέπεις, εγώ πήγα μέχρι την άκρη του κόσμου και γύρισα...
hfce067	Δεν είχα ιδέα ότι το ταξίδι στη Χώρα των Νεκρών θα ήταν γεμάτο με τόσους κινδύνους!
hfma068	Πόσα θα πλήρωνες λοιπόν, για να γλιτώσεις όλους τους μπελάδες;
hfce069	Έλα, αγαπητή μου.
hfce070	Ας ανεμοσκορπίσουμε το απόθεμα των χρημάτων μας, μαζί.
hfma071	Εντάξει, υποθέτω ότι δε σας πολυνοιάζει για τα προβλήματα μου.
hfce072	Ε, δεν είναι ότι δε μας νοιάζει, αλλά είμαστε κάπως απασχολημένοι...
hfma073	Αυτή είναι η γυναίκα σου, Celso;
hfce074	Ναι, μόλις γυρίσαμε από μια υπέροχη κρουαζιέρα...
hfce075	Δηλαδή, έγινε υπέροχη από τη στιγμή που βρεθήκαμε, μικρό μου κεφτεδάκι.
hfma076	Καλά, αφήστε με να αγορεύσω λιγάκι παραπάνω.
hfce077	Πραγματικά δε βλέπω πως κάτι τέτοιο θα μας βοηθήσει στην απόφαση μας...
hfma078	Λοιπόν, αν χρειάζεστε κι άλλη βοήθεια για να αποφασίσετε, εδώ γύρω θα 'μαι!
hfce079	Ναι, καλά, ευχαριστώ.
nlma001	Ε, κάποτε θα συνέβαινε και αυτό!
nlma002	Ay Chihuahua!
nlma003	Παρακαλώ; Περιστέρια;
nlma004	Φίλοι πλέον;
nlma005	Όχι, πρέπει να προφτάσω τη βαλίτσα πριν τα εισιτήρια διασκορπιστούν στον άνεμο!

nlma007	Νομίζω ότι το να χρησιμοποιήσουν το παλιό γκροτέσκ άγαλμα ως δομικό στήριγμα για τη γόησσα εδώ ήταν ΠΟΛΥ ΚΑΚΗ ιδέα.

nlma015	Στοίχημα ότι θα μπορούσα να περάσω στην αντίπερα σκεπή πάνω από το πόδι αυτής της πινακίδας...

hisa001	Manuel, άκουσε με προσεχτικά!
hisa002	Υπάρχει ένα όπλο στις αποσκευές του αυτοκινήτου, αλλά το κλειδί είναι στο σώμα μου, κάπου στο λιβάδι πίσω από το θερμοκήπιο!
hisa003	Βρες το!
hima004	Έγινε!
hisa005	Και πες στην Eva ότι ξέρω ότι θα διευθύνει τη Συμμαχία με σύνεση όταν εγώ θα έχω πεθάνει.
hisa006	Γιατί μόλις δαγκώσω αυτό το εκρήξιμο δόντι, ένα θανάσιμο σύννεφο θα "ανθίσει" όχι μόνο τον στόχο μου...

hima008	Τον στόχο σου; Τι είναι αυτά που--
hiol009	Έϊ! Φύγε από εκεί!
hisa010	Στο καλό, φίλε μου!
hiol011	Τι συζητούσατε με τον ΕΠΙΚΕΦΑΛΗ της ΣΧΨ εκεί μέσα;

mtch005	Προσπαθώ να χαλαρώσω λιγάκι--όλα αυτά τα χρόνια, έκανα κύκλους προς μια κατεύθυνση...
mtch006	Πρέπει να εξισορροπήσω τη ζωή μου σε αυτόν τον κόσμο πριν προχωρήσω στον επόμενο, ξέρεις!

syma209	Είναι ΤΕΡΑΣΤΙΟ.
syma210	Όχι.

syma173	Δεν θα μετακινήσω έπιπλα σήμερα.
syma191	Δεν μπορώ τώρα.
syma174	Όχι όσο με παρατηρεί.
syma214	Προτιμώ να μην το κάνω.
syma192	Αυτό πιθανότατα θα με έστελνε σε στρατοδικείο!
syma175	Δεν χρησιμοποιείται έτσι αυτό.
syma176	Τώρα μάλιστα, αυτό θα ήταν ΚΑΤΙ!
syma177	Δεν έχω τσέπη αρκετά μεγάλη για αυτό!
syma215	Ξέχασα το γερανό ρυμούλκησης στο άλλο μου κουστούμι.
syma178	Δεν χρειάζομαι τίποτα τέτοιο.
syma216	Αν το άγγιζα αυτό το ζουμί, θα κατέληγα με χειροπέδες από ζουμπούλια.
syma193	Το έχω κάνει αυτό ήδη.
syma194	Δε θέλω άλλο.
syma217	Δεν το χρειάζομαι.

syma184	Είναι μια σκάλα.
syma185	Είμαστε στο βυθό--όχι στο φεγγάρι.
syma186	Εκεί είναι η έξοδος.
syma197	Ο ανελκυστήρας είναι ήδη σε αυτό τον όροφο.
sytx187	Manny's hands
sytx188	Manny's hands
INTMA01	Συγγνώμη για την αναμονή, κύριε Flores.
INTMA02	Είμαι έτοιμος να σας πάρω τώρα.
INTCL03	Να με πάρετε; Να με πάτε που;
INTMA04	Ελάτε, τώρα...
INTMA05	Δεν υπάρχει λόγος να είστε νευρικός.
INTCL06	Ν-νευρικός; Ό-όχι... Α-α-απλά είναι η εμφάνιση σας... που, ξέρετε, είναι λιγάκι τρομακτική...
INTMA07	Τρομακτικός; Εγώ; Μα εγώ είμαι φίλος σου! Με λένε Manny Calavera. Είμαι ο καινούργιος ταξιδιωτικός σου πράκτορας!
INTCL08	Δε θέλω καινούργιο ταξιδιωτικό πράκτορα. Θέλω να πάω σπίτι.
INTMA09	Χα χα! Δεν μπορείς να πας σπίτι, Celso. Είσαι νεκρός. Μα δεν είσαι μόνος σου...
INTMA10	Όλοι εδώ είναι το ίδιο νεκροί με σένα.
INTMA11	Γι'αυτό και το ονομάσαμε "η Χώρα των Νεκρών."
INTMA12	Έτοιμος για το μεγάλο σου ταξίδι;
INTCL13	Όχι!
INTCL14	Ποιο ταξίδι;
INTMA15	Το τετράχρονο Ταξίδι της Ψυχής. Είναι μια αρκετά μεγάλη διαδρομή. Και δε θέλω να σου πω ψέματα, Celso.
INTMA16	Θα μπορούσε να είναι πολύ, μα πολύ επικίνδυνο.
INTMA17	Εκτός και αν...αποφασίσεις να διαθέσεις τα χρήματα με τα οποία σε θάψανε για να αγοράσεις από εμάς ένα καλύτερο ταξιδιωτικό πακέτο!
INTMA18	Θέλω να πω, δε θα προτιμούσες να διασχίσεις τη Χώρα των Νεκρών με το δικό σου σπορ αυτοκίνητο; Μήπως να δοκιμάσεις μια πολυτελή κρουαζιέρα στον ωκεανό; Ή αν έζησες μια πραγματικά καλή ζωή, μπορεί ακόμα και να δικαιούσαι ένα εισιτήριο για την ίδια την Νούμερο Εννέα (Ν-Ε)!
INTCL19	Την Νούμερο Εννέα;
INTMA20	Ναι πρόκειται για τη υψηλών-προδιαγραφών εξπρές αμαξοστοιχία μας. Εκτοξεύεται κατευθείαν στον Ένατο ’δη, στη Χώρα της Αιώνιας Αγαλλίασης, μέσα σε τέσσερα λεπτά αντί για τέσσερα χρόνια. Αλλά πολύ λίγοι άνθρωποι έχουν τα προσόντα για αυτό. Για να ρίξουμε μια ματιά στο φάκελο σου.
INTMA21	Χμμμ;
INTMA22	Χμμμ... Λοιπόν, τα άσχημα νέα είναι ότι το τρένο βρίσκεται λίγο έξω από τις δυνατότητες σου. Όμως, εξακολουθώ να κρύβω μερικούς άσσους στο μανίκι μου...
INTMA23	Χμμμ-Χμμμ... Α-χα. Ναι... Αυτό είναι ό,τι πρέπει...
INTMA24	...η "ΥΠΕΡΤΑΤΗ ΓΡΑΜΜΗ"!
INTMA25	Ναι, είναι πανέμορφη. Και αυτή η πυξίδα στην λαβή θα σου φανεί σίγουρα χρήσιμη...
INTMA26	Ω, θα κάνεις ένα απίθανο ταξίδι. Μακάρι να πήγαινα και εγώ!
INTCL27	Και γιατί δεν το κάνεις; Θα μπορούσες να με πάρεις μαζί σου.
INTMA28	Ω, δεν μπορώ να φύγω, αν δε ξεχρεώσω πρώτα ένα μικρό χρέος στους υψηλά ιστάμενους...
INTCL29	Κοινωνική υπηρεσία, ε;
INTCL30	Λοιπόν, τελικά μάλλον υπάρχουν και άτομα σε χειρότερη μοίρα από τη δική μου.
INTMA31	Μα, θα φύγω και εγώ από εδώ αρκετά σύντομα!
INTMA32	Αλλά όχι χάρη σε αδιέξοδες, χωρίς-προμήθεια, ποταπές υποθέσεις σαν τη δική σου, menso.
INTEV33	Έ, Manny. Το αφεντικό είπε να σου πω να μη φύγεις νωρίς απόψε. Θέλει να κουβεντιάσετε, όταν επιστρέψει από το ταξίδι του.
INTMA34	Πες του Don να μην ανησυχεί...
INTMA35	...δεν πρόκειται να πάω πουθενά.
INTMA36	Ειδικά με πελάτες σαν και αυτόν!
INTMA37	Μα που στην ευχή τους βρίσκουν αυτούς; Δεν έχουν τα προσόντα για τίποτα καλό, άρα ούτε κι εγώ μπορώ να πουλήσω τίποτα καλό, δεν μπορώ να εξοφλήσω τον χρόνο της θητείας μου, και έχω κολλήσει εδώ. Έχω κολλήσει στο να πουλάω μπαστούνια σε ένα μάτσο γαϊδούρια στον αιώνα τον άπαντα.
INTMA38	Χρειάζομαι καλύτερους πελάτες. Χρειάζομαι έναν πραγματικό άγιο. Χρειάζομαι ένα στοιχείο για να βρω έναν πλούσιο, νεκρό άγιο.
LOLMA01	Eva, κάνε ακόμα μια προσπάθεια για μένα σχετικά με αυτό.
LOLEV02	Λοιπόν εντάξει, αλλά μου ακούγεται πολύ θυμωμένος
LOLEV03	Κύριε Copal; Ο κύριος Calavera έχει κάτι εδώ που λέει ότι χρειάζεται να έχει την υπογραφή σας--
LOLCO04	Μπα, που να πάρει, Eva! Υπέγραψε το μόνη σου τέλος πάντων, εντάξει; Είμαι απασχολημένος!
LOLEV05	Θα πρέπει να τον συγχωρέσεις, Manny. Πιθανότατα έχει μπλέξει εκεί μέσα με ένα πολύ δύσκολο σταυρόλεξο σήμερα.
LOLMA06	Eva, με εντυπωσιάζεις.
LOLMA07	Δεν είχα ιδέα ότι έχεις τέτοια εξουσία.
LOLEV08	Λοιπόν, όλοι έχουμε τα μυστικά μας.
LOLGL09	Γντακ. Γκαχχ. Ααχ. Ναχ.
LOLGL10	Έϊ, δείχνω όμορφος με αυτό, έτσι δεν είναι; Χε χε.
LOLMA11	Ναι, λοιπόν, λένε ότι το μαύρο αδυνατίζει...
LOLGL12	Οδηγώ! Ω ναι! Οδηγώ'! ΒρρρρρρρουμμμμμΑαχαχα!
LOLGL13	Βρρρρρουμ!
LOLMA14A	Por favor.
BRPMA01	...προσφέρουμε πολλές δυνατότητες αναβάθμισης των ταξιδιωτικών πακέτων, αν θα θέλετε να--
BRPBO02	Κόψ' τη μουρμούρα. Θέλω κάτι φτηνό και ξεκούραστο, τίποτα παραπάνω.
BRPMA03	Αϊ αϊ αϊ.
BRPGL04	Ξέρεις, Manny, θα μπορούσα να κάνω αυτό το αμάξι γρηγορότερο. Αν το θες και εσύ...
BRPMA05	Ναι, ναι. Κάνε ό,τι καταλαβαίνεις.
BRPGL06	Ω ναι, θα χαμηλώσω την μύτη, θα κόψω το πίσω μέρος, διπλές εξατμίσεις θα ξεπετάγονται από το πάνω μέρος!
BRPGL07	Γουα-γουα-γουα-γουα-ΓΟΥΟΥΑΑΑΑΑΑΑ! Γουα-γουα-γουα-γουα-ΓΟΥΑΑΑΑΑΑΑΑΑΑ!
BRPMA08	Θα ξεκουραστείτε μια χαρά με αυτό τον τρόπο, Mr. Martinez, και θα είστε ασφαλής, παραγεμισμένος με τον αφρό που δημιουργείται όταν αυτά τα δύο χημικά αναμιγνύονται, όπως βλέπετε.
BRPBO09	Ε, τώρα που το ξανασκέφτομαι, θέλω να αναβαθμίσω το πακέτο μου!
BRPMA10	Λυπάμαι, Bruno, μα δεν έχεις ό,τι απαιτείται για κάτι καλύτερο.
BRPMA11	Ορίστε όμως, μπορείς να πάρεις αυτό το συνοδευτικό ποτήρι!
BRPBO12	Όχι! Περίμενε! Δε μπορείς να μου βρεις κάτι όπου θα μπορώ να κουνάω τα πόδια μου;
BRPMA13	Το ξέρεις πως θα το ήθελα, Bruno...
BRPMA14	...αλλά το αφεντικό μου είναι πραγματικά στριμμένο άντερο.
BRPCO15	Πρέπει να είμαι στριμμένος όταν έχω στη δούλεψη μου τεμπέληδες που απλά ανεμίζουν το δρεπάνι τους σαν κι ΑΥΤΟΝ τον χαζοχαρούμενο! Manny, δε θα μπορούσες να κάνεις καλές πωλήσεις ακόμα και αν ξεπουλούσαμε!
BRPMA16	Έχω μια πώληση εδώ!
BRPCO17	Μιλάω για τις πωλήσεις ΠΟΙΟΤΙΚΩΝ πακέτων, Calavera! Σαν αυτές που κάνει ο Domino!
BRPMA18	Πως περιμένετε από μένα να πουλήσω τα ακριβά πακέτα με τα αποβράσματα που μου στέλνετε για πελάτες;
BRPBO19	Εϊ!
BRPCO20a	Τώρα σου φταίνε οι πελάτες; Ως εδώ ήταν, Manny! Αν δεν κάνεις μια ποιοτική πώληση προτού βγει η επόμενη αναφορά πωλήσεων, απολύεσαι!
BRPBO21	Ποιόν είπες απόβρασμα ρε; Αν σε πιάσω--
RM1MA01	Glottis! Τρελάθηκες;  Τι σε έπιασε; Το αυτοκίνητο ήταν της εταιρείας!
RM1GL02	Ω, ναι! Και τώρα είναι ακόμα πιο ισχυρό! Μπες μέσα! Ιιιιιχα! Γοοου!
RM1MA03	Buenos dias.
RM1ME04	Εσύ δεν είσαι ο νοσοκόμος.
RM1MA05	Όχι.
RM1ME06	Δεν είσαι εδώ για να μου δώσεις το φάρμακό μου;
RM1MA07	Όχι, αλλά βρίσκομαι εδώ για να σου απαλύνω τον πόνο.
RM1ME08	Υποθέτω ότι δεν μπόρεσαν να με σώσουν, ε;
RM1MA09	Όχι, αλλά υπάρχει μια πιθανότητα να μπορέσεις να με σώσεις εσύ.
RM3CO01	Εϊ!  Κόκαλο-ξεκόκαλο!  Στο γραφείο μου!  Αυτή τη στιγμή!
RM3CO02	ΒΑΝΔΑΛΙΣΕΣ ιδιοκτησία της εταιρείας με σκοπό να αποκτήσεις ΑΠΟΡΡΗΤΗ ΠΛΗΡΟΦΟΡΙΑ ώστε να πάρεις μετά το ΠΑΡΑΝΟΜΑ ΤΡΟΠΟΠΟΙΗΜΕΝΟ εταιρικό αυτοκίνητο σου και τον ΜΗ ΚΑΤΑΧΩΡΗΜΕΝΟ ΟΔΗΓΟ σου και να σπρώξετε τον Domino εκτός πορείας--
RM3CO03	--και όλα αυτά για να κλέψεις ένα πελάτη από τον νόμιμο πράκτορά της!
RM3MA04	Δεν υπάρχει τίποτα το νόμιμο σε αυτό το μέρος. Δίνεις όλους τους καλούς πελάτες στον Domino.
RM3DO11	Manny, τώρα ντροπιάστηκα εξαιτίας σου.
RM3CO05	Ντρόπιασες ολόκληρη την υπηρεσία. Θα φωνάξω τη γυναίκα εδώ μέσα για να απολογηθείς σε αυτήν ο ίδιος.
RM3CO06	Eva, στείλε μέσα την δεσποινίς Colomar, σε παρακαλώ.
RM3EV07	Έφυγε πριν από δεκαπέντε λεπτά, αφεντικό. Είπε ότι είχε μακρύ περίπατο μπροστά της και ήθελε να ξεκινήσει.
RM3CO08	Περίπατο;! Είχε εισιτήριο για την Νούμερο Εννέα! Γιατί πιστεύει πως πρέπει να περπατήσει;
RM3MA09	Ήταν το καλύτερο πακέτο που μπόρεσα να της βρω...
RM3CO11	Αυτή η γυναίκα ήταν μια αγία και είχε σίγουρο το Ν-Ε εισιτήριο, το οποίο δεν πρόκειται να πάρει επειδή ΕΣΥ...
RM3CO12	...απλά δεν μπορούσες να το βρεις! Και τώρα, χάρη στα τεχνάσματα σου, αυτή βρίσκεται εκεί έξω...
RM3CO13	...ολομόναχη...
RM3CO14a	...περιπλανώμενη στο Απολιθωμένο Δάσος, αντιμετωπίζοντας δαίμονες του κάτω κόσμου μόνη και απροστάτευτη.
RM3CO15	Μπες μέσα και μείνε εκεί μέχρι τα παιδία στα κεντρικά να μας πουν τι θέλουν να γίνει με σένα. Κάποιος θα πληρώσει για ό,τι έγινε, Calavera, και αυτός δε θα είμαι εγώ!
LQ_MA01	Σκοπεύω να το ρίξω συθέμελο αυτό το μέρος!
LQ_SV02	Νεαρέ, εσύ είσαι εχθρός του Υπουργείου Θανάτου!
LSASV01	Salvador Limones και ένας φιλοξενούμενος.
LSAMA02	Που πηγαίνουμε;
LSASV03	Στα κεντρικά γραφεία της ΣΧΨ. 
LSAMA04	Της ΣΧΨ;
LSASV05	Η Συμμαχία των Χαμένων Ψυχών. Είμαστε μια μικρή ομάδα, Manuel, αλλά πάντα ψάχνουμε για νέους στρατιώτες.
LSAMA06	Που θα κάνουν τι, ακριβώς;
LSASV07	Χρειαζόμαστε ενίσχυση στην μονάδα αντικατασκοπίας μας. Με την Eva γνωριζόσαστε, φυσικά.
LSASV08	Και εγώ κάποτε ήμουν θεριστής όπως εσύ, Manuel. Αλλά ξεσκέπασα ένα πλέγμα διαφθοράς στο πολυαγαπημένο μας Υπουργείο Θανάτου.
LSASV09a	Έχω λόγους να πιστεύω ότι το Γραφείο Αποκτημάτων(Bureau of Acquisitions) εξαπατά τις ψυχές που έχει κληθεί να υπηρετήσει.
LSAMA10	Ποιες είναι οι αποδείξεις σου;
LSASV11	Εδώ έρχεσαι εσύ, Manuel. Η μήπως θα'πρεπε να σε αποκαλώ "Πράκτορα Calavera";
LSAMA12	Το "Manny" μου αρκεί. Δεν έχω πρόθεση να ενταχθώ σε καμιά στρατιωτική οργάνωση, Sal. Θέλω μόνο να με ξαναπάρουν στη δουλειά μου, για να εξοφλήσω δουλεύοντας τη θητεία μου και να φύγω από αυτό το αχούρι.
LSASV13a	Λοιπόν, δεν θα μπορέσεις να βγεις ούτε απ' την πόλη χωρίς τη βοήθεια μου. Που σημαίνει, φυσικά, ότι δε θα μπορέσεις να βρεις εκείνη τη γυναίκα και δε θα ξαναπάρεις ποτέ πίσω στη δουλειά σου.
ST1SV01	Πρέπει να πας στην πόλη Rubacava, φίλε μου, αν θέλεις να βρεις την χαμένη ψυχή που αναζητάς.
ST1MA02	Πώς το ξέρεις ΕΣΥ που βρίσκεται;
ST1SV03	Δε το ξέρω. Αλλά οποιοσδήποτε θέλει να φτάσει στον Ένατο ’δη θα πρέπει να περάσει τη Θάλασσα των Οδυρμών, και συνεπώς πρέπει να πάει στη Rubacava για να πάρει το πλοίο. Αν φτάσεις εκεί πριν από αυτή, θα την βρεις, αλλά ίσως χρειαστεί να περιμένεις αρκετά. 
ST1MA04	Θα περιμένω όσο χρειαστεί.
ST1SV05	Manuel; Μήπως είσαι...
ST1SV06	...ερωτευμένος μαζί της;
ST1MA07	Ερωτευμένος; Ο έρωτας είναι για τους ζωντανούς, Sal. Εγώ την ακολουθώ μόνο για ένα λόγο...
ST1MA08	...είναι το εισιτήριο μου για να βγω από εδώ.
CPDDO01	Κύριε LeMans, σας διαβεβαιώνω ότι η αγνοούμενη γυναίκα θα βρεθεί. Εγώ αυτοπροσώπως αναλαμβάνω να την εντοπίσω.
CPDHE02	Όπως αυτοπροσώπως άλλωστε την έφερες και εδώ από την Χώρα των Ζωντανών;
CPDDO03	Αυτή ήταν η πρόθεση μου, αλλά ο Πράκτορας Calavera με κάποιο τρόπο με πρόλαβε.
CPDHE04	Σου δώσαμε το πιο γρήγορο αυτοκίνητο, Domino. Σου δώσαμε όλους τους καλύτερους πελάτες. Είχες όλα τα πλεονεκτήματα, οπότε πως είναι δυνατόν αυτός ο Calavera να τρύπωσε και να σου πήρε την μπουκιά από το στόμα;
CPDCO05	Ω, έλα τώρα Hector, δε μπορείς να θυμώνεις και τόσο πολύ με τον Domino. Δεν ήταν δικό του το λάθος--
CPDHE06	Ω, μα μπορώ, Don. Θα έπρεπε να ξέρεις ότι ΜΠΟΡΩ να θυμώνω και τόσο πολύ. Αλλά όχι με τον Domino. Στο κάτω κάτω, δεν ήταν αυτός υπεύθυνος γι'αυτή την επιχείρηση.
CPDHE07	Τουλάχιστον, όχι μέχρι τώρα.
CPDCO08	Hector! Όχι!
CPDCO09	Αγγγγγγκ!
CPDHE10	Κατιφές... Χμ. Περίεργο...
CPDHE11	Για κάποιο λόγο, περίμενα τουλίπες. Λοιπόν, ίσως ο Κύριος Calavera, ε, Domino; Γιατί δεν πας "αυτοπροσώπως" κάτω στο υπόγειο να τον συνοδεύσεις εδώ πάνω; Όσο πιο γρήγορα τον "ανθίσουμε" και επιστρέψουμε στις δουλειές μας, τόσο το καλύτερο.
CPDGL12	Ω, Η ΚΑΡΔΙΑ! Η ΚΑΡΔΙΑ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΚΑΛΟ ΠΡΑΓΜΑ! ΝΑ ΕΙΜΑΙ ΚΑΛΟΣ ΜΕ ΤΗΝ ΚΑΡΔΙΑ! ΝΑ ΜΗΝ ΞΕΡΙΖΩΝΩ ΤΗΝ ΚΑΡΔΙΑ!  Η ΚΑΡΔΙΑ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΚΑΛΗ! ΚΑΛΗ ΚΑΡΔΙΑ ΜΕ ΓΕΡΟΥΣ ΧΤΥΠΟΥΣ--Έϊ, εκείνο εκεί είναι το αυτοκίνητό μου;
DBVMA01	(Λαχάνιασμα) Έϊ, αρκετά πια!
DBVGL02	Ω; Βρήκες κάποια φωτιά από κατασκήνωση; Χα χα!
DBVMA03	Δε θέλω να το συζητήσω.
GTSGL01	Manny, μέχρι τώρα ξύναμε το έδαφος σαν αρουραίοι, αλλά από εδώ και εμπρός, απογειωνόμαστε! Σαν αετοί! Ναι! ΣΑΝ ΑΕΤΟΙ...ΠΑΝΩ ΣΕ...ΡΑΒΔΙΑ ΜΕ ΕΛΑΤΗΡΙΑ!!!
GTSMA02	Τι ανακούφιση. Είχα αρχίσει να ανησυχώ πως το μεταφορικό μας μέσο δεν ήταν αρκετά φιγουρατζίδικο.
GTSGL03	Μπες μέσα! Ή μήπως φοβάσαι τα ύψη;
GTSMA04	Όχι, μόνο την ναυτία.
HLRGL01	Γεια χαρά!
HLRGL02	Δεσποινίς Colomar!
HLRGL03	Ήρθαμε να σας σώσουμε!
HLRMA04	Έϊ, σταμάτα τη φασαρία! Όλη η πόλη κοιμάται τέτοια ώρα!
HLRGL05	Μα θέλω να κάνω αγώνες αυτοκινήτων! Μόλις πάρουν πρέφα την αμαξάρα μου, θα μιλάει για μας όλη η πόλη! Χεχ.
HLRMA06	Δίκιο έχεις. Πρέπει να βρούμε ένα καλό μέρος να κρύψουμε αυτό το περιπλανώμενο τσίρκο.
HLRMA07	Και τώρα που είπα "να κρύψουμε", αναρωτιέμαι αν η Meche έφτασε κιόλας εδώ. Πάω να δω τι μπορώ να ανακαλύψω. Καθόλου κακό ακίνητο, βασικά. Έχει προοπτικές...
PLGMA01	Ααααααααααααααααααααααααααααχ!
PLGVL02	Ουφ, τουρίστες!
PLGVL03	Να προσέχεις που πατάς σε αυτά τα μέρη, ξένε. Η Rubacava δεν είναι πια το ειδυλλιακό λιμανάκι που ήταν κάποτε.
PLGVL04	Βρε βρε βρε. Σα να βλέπω ένα νέο καρυδότσουφλο στην πόλη. Συγγνώμη αλλά πάω να του ρίξω μια ματιά!
YR2LU01	Έϊ, Αφεντικό! Θα κατέβεις κάτω; Έχω ένα πελάτη που σε θέλει κάτι.
YR2MA02	Ξέρεις ότι δε μου αρέσει να ανακατεύομαι με τους πελάτες.
YR2LU03	Λοιπόν, ίσως να θες να ανακατευτείς με τη συγκεκριμένη.
SHGMA01	Meche;
SHGME02	Manny. Βοήθησε με. Είχα χαθεί για τόσο καιρό, γιατί δεν με έψαξες;
SHGMA03	Σε έψαξα! Έφυγες!
SHGMA04	Γιατί;
SHGME05	Επειδή είπες ότι δεν άξιζα. Ήμουν ολομόναχη στον κόσμο για ένα ολόκληρο χρόνο...
SHGME06	ΚΑΙ ΓΙΑ ΟΛΑ ΦΤΑΙΣ ΕΣΥ!
SHGVL07	Κάθε χρόνο τα ίδια θα έχουμε, Manny; Κάθε Μέρα των Νεκρών, θα πηδάς στη θάλασσα, και εγώ θα σε ψαρεύω έξω; Χμφ.
SHGMA08	Δε σκοπεύω να μείνω για πολύ ακόμα εδώ, Velasco.  Μόλις μάθω που πάει εκείνο το υπερωκεάνιο θα φύγω πίσω του.
SHGVL09	Χα!  Εκείνο το πλοίο πάει στο Puerto Zapato!  Αυτό είναι στην άλλη άκρη του κόσμου!  Δεν πηγαίνουν άλλα πλοία προς τα εκεί εκτός από το γερό-Limbo που βλέπεις
SHGVL10	...μα--
SHGMA11	Δεν έχει μα και ξε-μα.  Αν το Limbo είναι η μοναδική μου ελπίδα, τότε πες πως ήδη επιβιβάστηκα.
SHGVL12	Ε τοοοοότε, καλή τύχη, γιε μου.  Μόνο αυτό σου λέω. Χο χο! Χα χα χα χα!
SNAMA01	Lola;  Τι γυρεύεις εδώ;  Αυτό το πλήθος δε ψάχνει για αναμνηστικές φωτογραφίες. Εκτός ίσως από του Λένιν...
SNALO02	Σσσσ!  Manny, κάνω μυστική παρακολούθηση!  Θα αποδείξω στον Maximino μια για πάντα ότι η Olivia δεν είναι άξια γι'αυτόν.
SNAMA03	Ακόμα είσαι κολλημένη με τον Max, ε;  ’κου τη συμβουλή μου, ’γγελε μου.  Ξέχασε τον.  Είναι μπλεγμένος με παράνομο τζόγο--
SNALO04	Χα χα. Όπως και εσύ;
SNAMA05	Ω, με πληγώνεις, μωρό μου.
SNALO06	Σσσσσ!  Έρχονται!
SNAvi07	Έλα, γλύκα.  Δώσ'μου ένα φιλάκι πριν φύγω.
SNAOL08	Ωχ, αηδίες.  Μη με απογοητεύεις, Nick.  Είσαι δικηγόρος.  Υποτίθεται ότι δεν έχεις αισθήματα.
SNAvi09	Όχι αλλά ξέρω να ξεχωρίζω τα καλά "κομμάτια".
SNAvi10	Έϊ!
SNAvi11	Αν το δει αυτό ο Maximino, θα καταλήξουμε σε ταιριαστές γλάστρες για τη βεράντα του!
SNAOL12	Μην είσαι ανόητος.
SNAOL13	Δε θα μου έκανε κακό.
SNAOL14	Με ΑΓΑΠΑΕΙ.
PSOTS01	[Έϊ!  Κάτσε ακίνητος!]  Κάτσε ακίνητος!
PSOTS02	Τι είσαι;  ΠΕΘΑΜΕΝΟΣ!  Ακχ!
PSOTS04	Τι σόι ναύτης είσαι εσύ--ΟΥΦ!--Δεν αντέχεις το ποτό, ε;
PSOTS05	Velasco;  Toto!  Είναι εδώ ο ναύτης σου ο Naranja.
PSOTS06	Αγνοούσες την τύχη του;  Ε λοιπόν, μόλις ξεμεθύσει, τον στέλνω στο Limbo. Ναι, ναι-θα φτάσει εκεί προς το ξημέρωμα.  Το υπόσχομαι!
IDCVL01	Α, τι;
IDCMB02d	Naranja.
IDCVL03	Τις Πως;  Τον ανθίσανε;  Μα - Α αυτή η πόλη πάει κατά διαόλου!  Ένας ναύτης δε μπορεί ούτε να πάρει δυο μέρες άδεια στη ξηρά χωρίς να φυλάγεται συνέχεια Ναι, ναι.  Θα περάσω από εκεί το πρωί.
IDCVL04	(αναστεναγμός)
NREMA01	Πιστεύω ότι αυτά είναι τα λόγια που ψάχνεις.
NRETM01	...ποιος θα σταματήσει τις παχιές γάτες της βιομηχανίας από το να χτίσουν αυτά τα καράβια εκμεταλλευόμενοι τη "γύρη" που μαζεύει η εργατική τάξη;
NRESB02c	Ναι! ... μπουχτίσαμε πια ... Ναι! ... όχι άλλο ... Ναι! Ναι!
NRETM03	Λέω να αντιταχθούμε!
NRESB04a	Ναι! ... σιχαθήκαμε πια ... Ναι! ... όχι άλλο ... Ναι! Ναι!
NREBG05	Χμ. Τι γίνεται εδώ; Μήπως έχουμε κάποιο κηφήνα ταραξία;
NRETM06	Εγώ λέω να παρατήσετε τα εργαλεία σας αυτή τη στιγμή και να δείξετε στους διευθύνοντες ποιος "φτιάχνει το μέλι" εδώ πέρα!
NREBG07	Ως εδώ ήταν!
NRESB08a	(το πλήθος φωνάζει ρυθμικά "Συσπείρωση")
NREBG09	Ξέρεις, πάντα νόμιζα ότι οι μέλισσες έχουν δύο χρώματα: κίτρινο και μαύρο. Αλλά εσύ φιλαράκο μου φαίνεσαι κόκκινος. 
NRETM10	Αχ! Έϊ! Τι κάνεις εκεί; Έχουμε κάθε δικαίωμα να συγκεντρωνόμαστε ειρηνικά! 
NREBG11	Ωραία. Γιατί θα χρειαστείς πολύ συγκέντρωμα αφού σε διαλύσουμε, σύντροφε.
NRETM12	Manny! Βρες μου ένα δικηγόρο! Φέρε μου ένα δικηγόρο!
NRESB13a	(γογγυτό)
NREMA14	Ο Bogen; Προβλέπεται δύσκολη η απελευθέρωση του μικρού και η επιστροφή του εδώ έξω...
LLDLO01	Manny
LLDMA02	Lola;
LLDLO03	Πρόσεξε, Manny. Ίσως να μη θέλεις να με δεις σε αυτή την κατάσταση...
LLDMA04	Lola! Ο Nick σου το έκανε αυτό;
LLDLO05	Ναι, ήθελε πολύ εκείνη τη φωτογραφία. Αλλά δεν πρόκειται ποτέ να τη βρει, ο άτιμος.
LLDMA06	Θα τον κανονίσω, Lola. Θα δείξω στον Max τη φωτογραφία για χάρη σου και θα κανονίσω τον Nick για τα καλά. Μόνο πες μου που την έκρυψες.
LLDLO07	Ω, Manny, εγώ φταίω για όλα. Πάντα την πατούσα με τους λάθος άντρες. Ξέρεις, κάποτε είχα αισθήματα μέχρι και για σένα. Αλλά ήσουν τόσο κολλημένος με εκείνη τη Meche, που...που θεώρησα ότι δεν θα είχα καμιά ελπίδα.
LLDMA08	Lola, που βρίσκεται η φωτογραφία;
LLDLO09	Πες μου, Manny. Θα είχα ποτέ καμιά ελπίδα;
LLDLO10	Ξέχνα το.
LLDLO11	Μ-μόνο προειδοποίησε την Olivia για χάρη μου. Πες της να βελτιώσει το γούστο της στους άνδρες αλλιώς θα καταλήξει σαν εμένα. Πες της να βρει ένα καλό άνθρωπο, Manny, σαν κι εσένα...
LLDMA12	Lola! Lola!
P39MA01	Κοίτα τι βρήκα στο θάλαμο του φώτο-φίνις
P39MA02	Φαίνεται πως η "’τακτη Γατούλα" και ο "Λιγδιάρης Γάτος" είναι απόλυτα ισόπαλοι
P39vi03	Τι θέλεις;
P39MA05	Θέλω να σου πω μια ιστορία για ένα νεαρό άνδρα, που φυλακίστηκε αδίκως, μόνο και μόνο επειδή είπε αυτό που σκεφτόταν
P39TM06	Ώρα να ταρακουνήσουμε το μελίσσι!
P39vi07	Υποθέτω ότι με αυτό τακτοποιούνται οι υποθέσεις μας.
P39MA08	Σχεδόν.
P39vi09	Ε; Αυτό ήταν για το κορίτσι για τις φωτογραφίες;
P39MA10A	Όχι. Ήταν απλά γιατί είσαι αυτός που είσαι.
BRBSN01	Δεκατέσσερα! Το δεκατέσσερα είναι ο νικητής!
BRBSN02	Le quatorze! Numiro quatorze est le gagnant!
BRBBG03	Νομίζω ότι εννοείς το δύο, κάνω λάθος;
BRBSN04	Ε, όχι monsieur. Το δεκατέσσερα είναι ο νικητής.
BRBBG05	Νομίζω ότι έκανες ένα λάθος.
BRBSN06	Λυπάμαι, κύριε. Το δεκατέσσερα είναι ο νικητήριος αριθμός. Την επόμενη φορά ίσως είστε πιο τυχερός, ε;
BRBBG07	Ως εδώ ήταν! Αυτός ο Calavera παραμεγάλωσε για τα παντελόνια που φορά. Δε μου αρέσει να εισβάλω σε επιχειρήσεις, και να βάζω λουκέτο, αλλά κάποιος πρέπει να δώσει ένα μάθημα στον Manuel περί νόμου και τάξης.
BRBBG08	Από δω, εδώ πίσω, Ανοίξτε τις κλούβες και ξεκινήστε να τις γεμίζετε. Και κάποιος να βρει τον Calavera. Θέλω να τον ανακρίνω αυτοπροσώπως!
BRBGL10	Έι, έλα τώρα! Πρέπει να με αφήσεις να ξαναμπώ! Είμαι VIP (=Πολύ Σημαντικό Πρόσωπο)!
BRBMA11	Αυτό σημαίνει Πολύ Σουρωμένος Πιανίστας;
BRBGL12	Α, Manny. Δεν θέλω πια να είμαι πιανίστας. Είμαι μηχανικός!
BRBMA13	Το ξέρω. Γι'αυτό και εγώ σου βρήκα νέα δουλειά. Έλα μαζί μου, πάμε να πάρουμε τα εργαλεία σου.
BRBGL14	Και μπορώ να κάνω ό,τι θέλω στη μηχανή; Να την κάνω γρηγορότερη;
BRBVL15	Φυσικά, αλλά μάλλον θα είσαι πολύ απασχολημένος μόνο με το να την κρατήσεις στην επιφάνεια.
BRBMA16	Ευχαριστώ για τη δουλειά. Και που δεν μου έκανες πολλές ερωτήσεις.
BRBVL17	Διάολε, μετά από αυτό που συνέβη στον Naranja, καταλαβαίνω γιατί φεύγεις. Ελπίζω μόνο να μη σε ψαρεύω πάλι από το βυθό.
BRBMA18	Θα μείνω στον πάτο την επόμενη φορά, το υπόσχομαι.
BRBEN19	Καπετάνιε; Καπετάνιε Calavera;
BRBMA20	Το Puerto Zapato, ναύτη! Φτάσαμε επιτέλους! Θαυμάσιο λιμάνι, δε βρίσκεις;
BRBEN21	Μάλιστα καπετάνιε! Είναι κάτι τελωνειακοί κάτω, καπετάνιε. Θέλουν να ερευνήσουν το πλοίο.
BRBMA22	Εντάξει, εντάξει. Δεν έχουμε και τίποτα να κρύψουμε, ε;
BRBMA23	Δεν κρύβουμε σκελετούς στα ντουλάπια μας! Χα χα!
BRBEN24	Μάλιστα καπετάνιε!
BRBMA25	Σταθεροποιήστε την πλώρη, ναύτες! Σαν βράχο αυτή τη φορά!
BRBSV26	Manuel--
BRBMA27	Salvador;
HTSSM01	Έϊ! Εδώ πίσω είναι!
HTSLM02	Τσουβαλιάστε τον!
HTSLM03	Υπάλληλοι Τελωνείου!  Ανοίξτε αμέσως αυτή την πόρτα!
HTSSM04	Ναι, θέλουμε να ελέγξουμε τις αποσκευές σας.
HTSGL05	Μην ανησυχείς, Manny.  Είμαστε ασφαλείς εδώ μέσα.
HTSLM06	Εντάξει, ας τοποθετήσουμε τα εκρηκτικά και να εξαφανιστούμε από εδώ.
ESCMA01	Λίγο ακόμα πιο μακριά, Glottis!
HDFGL02	Γκρρκπτ!  Manny!
HDFMA03f	Έλα τώρα, φέρσου απλά σαν ένα ήρεμο άτομο μέχρι να καταλάβω τι πρέπει να κάνω εδώ
PRLCH01	Αχ!  Με ληστεύουν!  Ωχ, ωχ.  Πάρτε το πορτοφόλι μου!  Μόνο μη μου κάνετε κακό!
PRLMA02b	Αυτό που θα κάνουμε όλοι είναι να πάμε ένα μικρό περίπατο.
PRLGL03	Για που;
PRLMA04b	Στο Μαργαριτάρι.
PRLGL01	Αυτό εκεί πέρα είναι;
PRLMA02	Πρέπει να είναι αυτό.
PRLCH03	Χου-γουιι! Εγώ προτείνω να το πάρουμε!  Είμαστε ΠΛΟΥΣΙΟΙ!
PRLMA04	Σσσσ!  Κάτι τρέχει.
PRLGL05	Manny;  Τι συμβαίνει εδώ;
SUBCH01b	Α!  ’σε με να φύγω!
SUBCH01	Ααααχ!  Τα φρύδια μου με εγκαταλείπουν!  Αυτός ο βράχος προσπαθεί να ξεκολλήσει τα στρείδια μου!
SUBCH02	Ααααχ, οουουχ, εϊ αυτό το στρείδι είναι δικό μου.
SUCH181	Ας το κάτω αυτό.
SUCH182	Έϊ, άσε με ήσυχο.
SUCH183	Κόφ'το.
SUCH184	’φησε με να φύγω!
SUBMA07	Επιστρέφει.
SUBGL08	Ας κρυφτούμε εδώ.
SUBMA09	Φαίνεται ότι πορευόμαστε νότια.
SUBGL10	Μα δεν υπάρχει τίποτα σε εκείνη την άκρη του κόσμου. Εκτός από...
SUBMA11	Την άκρη!
SUBGL13	Manny;
SUBMA14	Μη ρωτάς φίλε, γιατί δεν ξέρω.
REUMA01	Meche!
REUME02	Manny! Τι κάνεις εδώ;
REUMA03	Ήθελα να δω πως πηγαίνει το ταξίδι σου, καλή μου. Είμαι ο ταξιδιωτικός σου πράκτορας ξέρεις. Επί τη ευκαιρία, ευχαριστώ για εκείνο το μπουκάλι της σαμπάνιας που μου έστειλες. Με βάρεσε πραγματικά κατακέφαλα.
REUME04	Προχωρούσες σε παγίδα, προσπαθούσα να σε προειδοποιήσω. Ο Domino με χρησιμοποιούσε σαν δόλωμα. Δεν ήθελα να καταλήξεις φυλακισμένος εδώ πέρα σαν εμένα.
REUMA05	Φυλακισμένη; Πού είναι το κελί σου; Ή μήπως απλά μοιράζεσαι την κουκέτα σου με τον δεσμοφύλακα;
REUME06	Αν αυτή είναι η γνώμη σου για μένα...
REUME07	Τότε γιατί ήρθες εδώ πέρα;
REUDO08	Γιατί εδώ είναι που ανήκει.
REUDO09	Εδώ. Να εργάζεται για μένα.
REUDO10	Το ήξερα ότι θα ερχόσουν τελικά. Σωστό ή λάθος, ο Manuel Calavera πάει πάντα με τους νικητές, έτσι Manny; Γι'αυτό βρίσκεσαι τώρα εδώ.
REUMA11	Φεύγω από αυτό το βράχο, και παίρνω μαζί μου όλους αυτούς τους ανθρώπους.
REUDO12	Χαχαχαχαχα! Manny, δεν υπάρχει τρόπος να φύγεις από αυτό το νησί. Φοβάμαι πως κόλλησες εδώ στο μικρό μου πρόγραμμα διοικητικής εκπαίδευσης. Βλέπεις, θέλω να πάρεις τη θέση μου εδώ, μικρέ. Πρέπει να επιστρέψω πίσω στην πόλη που έχει δράση.
REUGL13	Λυπάμαι, Manny, αλλά έπρεπε να έρθω. Το δέρμα μου ξεραινόταν.
REUDO14	Αυτόν, δεν τον χρειάζομαι.
REUMA15	Θα σε λιώσω σε σκόνη γι'αυτό, cabron.
REUDO16	Ίσως αργότερα...
REUDO17	Αλλά για τώρα, άσε με να σου δείξω το νέο σου γραφείο.
REUMA18	Ουφ.
POSGL01	Γιιιιιιιχα!
POSMA02	Δεν μπορώ να το πιστέψω ότι το έκανες να επιπλέει. Απίστευτο! Χα χα χα!
POSGL03	Αυτό ήταν το εύκολο μέρος. Το δύσκολο θα είναι να φύγουμε σπάζοντας αυτό το μεγάλο κοραλλένιο ύφαλο εκεί έξω!
POSMA04	Να σπάσουμε τον μεγάλο κοραλλένιο ύφαλο, ε; Χμμμ...
POSMA05	Λοιπόν, τυγχάνει να έχω κάποιον εξοπλισμό στην παραλία που μπορεί να σε ενδιαφέρει
EXOMA01	Δουλεύει σαν τρελό! Πρόσω ολοταχώς!
EXODO02	Τι;
EXOME04	Λοιπόν, θα με πας στ' αλήθεια πίσω και θα προσπαθήσεις να πάρεις πίσω την παλιά σου δουλειά;
EXOMA05	Δεν υπάρχει δουλειά για μένα πια, εκτός από το να φέρω εσένα και όλους τους άλλους εδώ πέρα στο τέρμα του δρόμου.
EXOME06	Μα αν δεν θα σκοπεύεις να με χρησιμοποιήσεις για να πάρεις πίσω τη δουλειά σου, γιατί ξόδεψες όλον αυτό το χρόνο προσπαθώντας να με βρεις;
EXOMA07	Meche, εγώ...
EXOMA08	...είχα ανάγκη να σε βρω.
EXODO09	Σου έδωσα ΜΙΑ δουλειά, Manny!
EXOMA10	Ουφ.
EXODO11	Και για κοίτα, ήδη τα θαλάσσωσες!
EXODO12	Υποθέτω ότι συνειδητοποιείς πως αυτό θα ΓΡΑΦΤΕΙ στο προσωπικό σου αρχείο...
CRUDO01	Δε σε ΠΙΣΤΕΥΩ, Calavera...
CRUDO02	Χάνεις τον καυγά και γι'αυτό τα βάζεις με ένα από τα κατοικίδια μου;;;
CRUDO03	Γιατί δεν μπορείς να είσαι περισσότερο σαν εμένα, Manny; Προσπάθησα να σου δείξω πως, αλλά δεν ακούς. Αν απλά υιοθετούσες τη σωστή συμπεριφορά...
CRUDO04	...απλά κοίτα τι θα μπορούσε να σου συμβεί!
CRUDO05	Αααχχ!
CRUGK06	Όνομα;
CRUPP07	Pugsy Peligiano, κύριε.
CRUGK08	Χμμμ. Δωμάτιο αναμονής νούμερο δύο. ΕΠΟΜΕΝΟΣ!
CRUGL09	Ωωωω...
CRUMA10	Glottis; Glottis; Estas bien;
HTRMA01	Έι. Πού είναι όλοι;
HTRGK02	Στο δωμάτιο αναμονής δύο.
HTRMA03	Για πόσο θα πρέπει να περιμένουν εκεί μέσα;
HTRGK04	Μέχρι να έχουν εισιτήρια. Τους χορηγήθηκαν εισιτήρια για το Νούμερο Εννέα και δεν τα έχουν τώρα. Η τιμωρία για την πώληση των Ν.Ε. εισιτηρίων είναι ΠΟΛΥ αυστηρή.
HTRMA05	Μα δεν πούλησαν αυτοί τα εισιτήρια του, τα εισιτήρια τους κλάπηκαν!
HTRGK06	Από ποιόν;
HTRMA07	Ο Hector LeMans τα έκλεψε για να τα πουλήσει σε πλούσιους ανθρώπους που δεν τα αξίζουν.
HTRGK08	Μπορεί να είναι αυτοί που έρχονται. Ας δούμε τι ακριβώς αξίζουν.
HTRMA09	Τι στο--
HTRGK10	Ούτε ΑΥΤΟΙ είχαν εισιτήρια. Όχι αληθινά, εν πάσει περιπτώσει.
HTRMA11	Ψεύτικα εισιτήρια; Να γιατί ο Hector έκρυβε όλα αυτά τα πλαστά εισιτήρια! Τα πουλάει αντί για τα αληθινά. Αλλά αυτό σημαίνει ότι πρέπει να έχει ακόμα τα αληθινά
BRUMA01	Bruno;  Bruno Martinez;
BRUBO02	ΕΣΥ!  Εσύ είσαι ο τύπος που με πακετάρισε εκεί μέσα! Μπορούσες τουλάχιστον να μου δώσεις ένα περιοδικό! Τέσσερα χρόνια χωρίς τίποτα να διαβάσω παρά αυτό το αναθεματισμένο κύπελλο!
BRUBO04	Φεύγω από εδώ μέσα. Αυτό ο κόσμος είναι για κορόιδα.
CFRM101	Σε εκτοξεύουμε τώρα σαν βέλος στον άνεμο. Είθε να τρυπήσεις την καρδιά του άνεμου του ίδιου και να πιεις το αίμα της πτήσης.
CFRM202	Η ταχύτης είναι η τροφή του Μέγα Glottis!
CFRM103	Η ταχύτης σου φέρνει ζωή.
CFRM204	Επέστρεψε σε μας μια μέρα!
CFRME08	Είσαι σίγουρος ότι αυτό το πράγμα δε θα διαλυθεί;
CFRMA09	Ε, τουλάχιστον για το μεγαλύτερο μέρος της διαδρομής. Ε, κοίτα! Είμαστε ήδη στην Rubacava!
CFRGL10	Ω...Manny; MANNY; Manny, πού είσαι;
CFRGL11	MANNY;!; ΦΟΒΑΜΑΙ!
CFRGL12	Α, Rubacava!  Τι πόλη!  Θυμάσαι τις ένδοξες μέρες, Manny;
CFRMA13	Περασμένες μέρες, φίλε μου. Δεν υπάρχει τίποτα για εμάς εδώ τώρα.
CFRGL14	Εκτός ίσως από το παλιό μας αυτοκίνητο;
VMAGL01	Εντάξει! Ήρθε η ώρα να λιώσουμε τους δρόμους!
VMAOL02	Αν πρόκειται να κυνηγήσεις τον Hector LeMans, τότε έρχομαι μαζί.
VMAME03	Μπορείς να μοιραστείς μια θέση μαζί μου.
VMAME04	Νομίζω.
VMAMA05	Απ' ότι φαίνεται ο Hector έχει καταλάβει ολόκληρη την πόλη.
VMAOL06	Δεν είχε πολύ αντίσταση. Υπάρχει μόνο μια ομάδα ανθρώπων που αντιστέκεται, και ζούνε στις περιθωριακές περιοχές έξω από την πόλη.
VMAMA07	Περιοχές σαν αυτές, εννοείς;
VMAME08	Ελπίζω να μην χτυπάνε τον Glottis.
VMAOL09	Χα! Δείχνει ότι δεν έχεις ιδέα για αυτή την ομάδα! Ο ηγέτης τους είναι ένας σπουδαίος άντρας που--
VMASV10a	Manuel Calavera. Συναντιόμαστε ξανά. Βλέπω ότι βρήκες αυτό που αναζητούσες. Τι τύχη να φτάσεις τώρα καθώς και εμείς επίσης, είμαστε έτοιμοι να εκπληρώσουμε τον στόχο μας
VMAUN11	Παγίδα! Ήταν παγίδα!
VMASV12	Σταθείτε πίσω! Υπάρχει μόνο ένα πράγμα να κάνουμε.
VMAME13	<γκασπ>
VMASV15	Τι είπες για μια παγίδα;
VMAUN16	Ο Hector ξεσκέπασε τον πράκτορα μας στο εργαστήριο όπλων του.
VMASV17	Όχι!
VMAHE18	Ηλίθιε, Bowlsley! Ο νέος σου βοηθός εργαστηρίου είναι ΚΑΤΑΣΚΟΠΟΣ!
VMAHE19	Δεν έχεις ακούσει ποτέ για ΕΛΕΓΧΟ ΠΑΡΕΛΘΟΝΤΟΣ!
VMAMA20	Τι;
VMASV21	Δεν έχουμε καιρό για εξηγήσεις. Τώρα πρέπει να πάρω την υπόθεση στα χέρια μου...
VMAOL22	Πάρε με μαζί σου. Λαχταρούσα να υπηρετήσω το κίνημα σου εδώ και χρόνια.
EBDBW01	Ε;
EBDBW02	Ένας από τους αγγελιοφόρους του Hector...
EBDBW03	Μ-μ-με ένα μ-μ-μήνυμα για μένα;
EBDBW04	"Ξέρω τι σκαρώνεις. Σε παρακολουθούσα; Έρχομαι να σε "ανθίσω" αυτοπροσώπως;!; Χαιρετισμούς, Hector LeMans!" Το 'ξερα!!!
EBDBW05	Το 'ξερα πως ήθελε να με ξεκάνει όλο αυτόν τον καιρό.
EBDBW06	Δε θα βρεις ποτέ το μυστικό μου καταφύγιο, Hector. Θα πρέπει να βρεις άλλον ανθοκόμο!
ODJHE01b	ΕΣΥ!  Εσύ είσαι αυτός που έπεισε τους Flores μόλις τώρα;
ODJMA02	Μακάρι να το έβλεπες. Ήταν ένα παλιό κόλπο.
ODJHE03b	Κάτσε εκεί. Πρέπει να πάρω δυό υπογραφές, αλλά μετά θέλω να πάμε μια βόλτα μαζί στην πόλη.
ODJHE01a	Μιλάμε απλά για μια δουλειά εδώ; Ή μιλάω για μια ευκαιρία, με την γενική έννοια;
ODJHE02	Αυτό θα μπορούσε να είναι το γραφείο σου.
ODJHE03	Ορίστε. Δοκίμασε το αυτό. Δες πως το νιώθεις. Είναι και αυτό δικό σου.
ODJHE04	Και, σαν επιπρόσθετο μπόνους...
ODJHE05	Δύο τοις εκατό από αυτά, Κύριε εε...
ODJMA06	Το όνομα μου είναι Calavera, και θέλω μεγαλύτερο μερίδιο.
ODJHE07	Χμ-μμ-μμ,εχ,ε,α, μα Κύριε Calavera... Θα χρειαστώ τα περισσότερα από αυτά για να βγω ο ίδιος από αυτόν τον κόσμο. Βλέπετε, ήμουν πολύ κακό παιδί. Χα χα!
ODJMA08	Θα παραδώσω αυτά τα εισιτήρια στους δίκαιους ιδιοκτήτες τους...
ODJMA09	...και θα παραδώσω εσένα σε ένα μείγμα αποσύνθεσης.
ELDMA01	Αυτό πρέπει να είναι το δικό σου.
ELDGL02	Μην ξεχάσεις να στείλεις βοήθεια!
ELDME03	Ααααααα!
ELDMA04	’ι! Τρέχα! Βρες τον Salvador!
ELDOL05	Μπες μέσα, γρήγορα!
ELDMA06	Υποτίθεται ότι θα είχαμε κάλυψη εκεί πίσω! Πού είναι όλοι οι άντρες του Salvador;
ELDOL07	Δεν ξέρω.
ELDOL08	Δε μου είπε ακόμα.
ELDOL09	Ήρθε η ώρα να χορέψεις, φιλαράκι. Να σε βλέπω να περπατάς.
SVSHE01	Μ'αγαπά...
SVSHE02	...δε μ'αγαπά...
SVSMA03	Λοιπόν, έχεις μισό δίκιο.
SVSHE04	Ω Manny... τόσο κυνικός... Τι σου συνέβη, Manny, που σε έκανε να χάσεις την ελπίδα σου, την αγάπη σου για τη ζωή;
SVSMA05	Πέθανα.
SVSHE06	Κατάλαβα, χμ-μμ, υποθέτω πως ο Domino είχε δίκιο, δεν έχεις ούτε κομματάκι αισιοδοξίας.
SVSMA07	Λοιπόν, όσον αφορά τα κομματάκια, ο Dom είναι ειδικός.
SVSHE08	Και με την ίδια λογική, Manny, εσύ πρόκειται να γίνεις ειδικός στην βοτανική.
SVSMA09	Τώρα είναι που υποτίθεται ότι μου λες για το μυστικό σου σχέδιο; Για το πως έκλεψες Ν.Ε. εισιτήρια από αθώες ψυχές, παριστάνοντας ότι τα πουλούσες αλλά στην πραγματικότητα τα έκρυβες για τον εαυτό σου σε μια απεγνωσμένη προσπάθεια να βγεις από τη Γη των Νεκρών;
SVSHE10	Όχι.
SVSHE11a	Χεε-α, χα, αχ, χα...Τώρα είναι που σπαρταράς με βασανιστικούς πόνους για περίπου μια ώρα διότι ο ηλίθιος ο Bowlsley το έσκασε με όλη την Ανθόλη γρήγορης δράσης
SVSHE12	Manny; Πού πας; Έχουμε ακόμα ώρα μέχρι να φύγεις..."φύλλε" μου. Χα χα χα!
ENDME01	Μπορείτε να τα μετρήσετε αν θέλετε. Είναι όλα εδώ.
ENDGK02	Και το δικό σου;
ENDMA03	Η εταιρία μου έδωσε ένα, κάτι σαν δώρο συνταξιοδότησης. Και, α...
ENDMA04	Τα Δαιμόνια ανεβαίνουν δωρεάν, σωστά;
ENDGL05	Α, Manny. Ξέρεις ότι δε μπορώ να έρθω μαζί σου. Είμαι πνεύμα της φύσης και όλα αυτά. Δεν μπορώ ποτέ να φύγω από αυτό τον κόσμο.
ENDMA06	Υποθέτω ότι παρασύρθηκα τόσο πολύ στο να σώζω κόσμο, που πίστεψα ότι θα μπορούσα να σώσω και εσένα.
ENDGL07	Ναι, αλλά εγώ...δε χρειάζομαι να σωθώ. Μ'αρέσει εδώ. Δεν είμαι ολομόναχος σ'αυτό το υπόγειο πια, χάρη σε σένα. Έχω καινούργια δουλειά και όλους αυτούς τους νέους φίλους. Είμαι ένα πετυχημένο δαιμόνιο.
ENDMA08	Λοιπόν...φαντάζομαι πως αυτό ήταν, ε;
ENDMA09	Οοοοφ!
ENDGL10A	Έλα δω. Δως μου μια αγκαλιά.
ENDMA11	Μμμμφ φρμ μρφφ μρφ οοφ!
ENDME12	Manny;
ENDMA13	Ναι;
ENDME14	Όταν θα πάμε στον επόμενο κόσμο...
ENDMA15	Τι είναι, καλή μου;
ENDME16	Θα είμαστε μαζί;
ENDMA17	Ξέρεις γλυκιά μου, αν υπάρχει ένα πράγμα που έμαθα, είναι αυτό: κανείς δεν ξέρει τι θα συμβεί στο τέλος της διαδρομής, γι'αυτό ας απολαύσει το ταξίδι.
TMPTS01	Έι! Κλείσε την πόρτα! Επιβραδύνεται η συσκευή, πολύ επίπονο! Πολύ επίπονο, ε Naranja; Σαν βασανιστήριο, Χεχεχε...χεχε;
TMPTS02	Κλείσε την αναθεματισμένη πόρτα! Δεν έχει τίποτα να φας! Αν θέλεις να τσιμπήσεις κάτι, τράβα βρες μητέρα!
TMPTS03	Έξω από το ψυγείο μου!  [Μη με αναγκάσεις να έρθω εκεί και να σε πλακώσω στο ξύλο!]
TMPTS04	Θα σε σκοτώσω!
TMPTS05	Ε;  Ποιός είναι εκεί πέρα;
TMPTS06	[Τι στο διάολο;]  Κοίτα! Το έσπασες.
TMPTS07	Τώρα δεν κλείνει.
TMPTS08	Όταν τελειώσω με τον Naranja από εδώ, θα φτιάξω μεγάλα αυτιά στα πλάγια του κεφαλιού σου για να ξέρει ο κόσμος τι γαϊδούρι είσαι!
TMPTS09	(απασχολημένο γρύλισμα)
TMPTS10	Αργκ. Όχι τώρα, Manny.  Έχω μια δουλειά με τον Naranja από εδώ.
TMPTS11	Σου είπα Calavera, όχι τώρα.
TMPTS13	Με ωθείς στα άκρα, Calavera!
TMPTS14	Γιατί είσαι εδώ κάτω, τέλος πάντων;
TMPTS15	Α, άντε χάσου!
TMPTS16	Δεν πας να διευθύνεις κανένα φανταχτερό;
TMPTS17	Τράβα μάρκαρε κάρτες ή κάτι τέτοιο.
TMPTS18	Σκάσε!
TMPTS19	Ναι, πρέπει να θυμηθώ να πάρω κι άλλο υγρό άζωτο από το νεκροτομείο.
TMPTS20	Παγώνει τα κόκαλα, λιγότερο οδυνηρό έτσι.
TMPTS21	Έχεις πολλά αναισθητικά σ'αυτό το μπουκάλι, γι'αυτό σκάσε και κάτσε ακούνητος!
TMPTS22	Σκοτώνω τον πόνο. Κλείνω τρυπάνι, σταματώ να δουλεύω. Τι λες γι'αυτό;
TMPTS23	Θα σε "ανοίξω", ναυτόπαιδο
TMPTS24	Πρέπει να μείνεις ακούνητος, ή θα χρειαστεί να σε δέσω κάτω.
TMPTS25	Κρύψε αυτή την τρελή λεπίδα. Δεν είναι εδώ το μέρος για τέτοια πράγματα!
TMPTS26	Τι είναι αυτό; Μου κάνουν έλεγχο; Είσαι του υπουργείου υγείας ή κάτι τέτοιο; Φύγε από δω. Πλήρωσα αυτό το μήνα.
TMPTS27	Δεν εντυπωσιάστηκα.
TMPTS28	Πολύ μεγάλο -- Βγάλε όλο το χέρι. Κάν'το αυτό μόνο αν το σχέδιο δε βγήκε καλό.
TMPTS29	Χα!  Ο Κομμουνισμός πέθανε!
TMPTS30	Αλλά τουλάχιστον υπήρχε μια εποχή που το "ΕΓΩ" λειτουργούσε. Ε; Χα χα χα!
TMPTS31	Τι; Προσπαθείς να μου πουλήσεις κάτι;
TMPTS32	Χμμμ. Έχω να φάω Lengua (γλώσσα) από τότε που έκλεισες τον αυτόματο πωλητή! (αναστεναγμός) Εσύ και το φαντεζί φαγητό σου, (γκρινιάζοντας) με το μαϊντανό και τους κύκνους
TMPTS33	Manny, αν δε σε πειράζει;  Εργάζεται καλλιτέχνης εδώ, ε;
TMPTS34	Ω ναι, ναι, ναι. Αυτό του είπα.
TMPTS35	Με δουλεύεις;
TMPTS36	Εγώ του έδωσα την ιδέα αρχικά!
TMPTS37	Α, η τίγρης δεν αλλάζει τις ρίγες της.
TMPTS38	Λοιπόν σκοπεύεις ακόμα να πας;
TMPTS39	Έι, άκουσε με--πρέπει να προσέξεις τον εαυτό σου.
TMPTS40	Ναι. Ναι, ναι. Ναι.
TMPTS41	Α-χα. Α-χα. Α-χα.
TMPTS42	Βεβαίως.
TMPTS43	Βεβαίως, φυσικά.  Καταλαβαίνω.
TMPTS44	Οπωσδήποτε.
TMPTS45	Μμμμ-χμμμ. Μμμμ.χμμμ.
TMPTS46	Εσύ το είπες αυτό;
TMPTS47	Έχεις κότσια!
TMPTS48	Ναι, αλλά δεν θα το έλεγα αυτό ακριβώς "ποιοτικός χρόνος"
TMPTS49	Λοιπόν, τι έγινε μετά το δείπνο;
TMPTS50	Αχ-χα. Αχ-χα.
TMPTS51	Ω, πλάκα μου κάνεις!
TMPTS52	Ω, δεν το πιστεύω.
TMPTS53	Και για παιδιά;
TMPTS54	Αυτό είναι μεγάλο κρίμα.
TMPTS55	ΜΜΜΜΜ
TMPTS56	Λοιπόν, αν δε μου το έλεγες εσύ, θα μου το έλεγε κάποιος άλλος.
TMPTS57	Θα σου έλεγα αλλά δε μπορώ.
TMPTS58	Είναι και κάποιος άλλος εδώ.
TMPTS59	Ας πούμε απλά ότι είναι άσχημα.
TMPTS60	Ναι. Ναι. Χύθηκαν δάκρυα.
TMPTS61	Όχι, όχι, όχι...λέγε.  Πες τα μου όλα. Ακούω.
TMPTS62	Ε, περίμενε ένα λεπτό.
TMPTS63	Α Α Α! Φύγε από εκεί!
TMPTS64	Όχι, όχι!  Μα που σου 'ρθε;
TMPTS65	’πλωσε το χέρι σου ξανά, και θα πάρεις πίσω ένα απολειφάδι!
TMPTS66	Εννοείς εκτός από το τραγούδι, το ποίημα, το μπαρ και το άγαλμα με αυτό το όνομα;
TMPTS67	Φυσικά! Είναι ένα από τα πιο διάσημα σχέδια μου! Κοίτα, θα σου δείξω!

TMPTS70	Ω, ω, ναι. Η Lola ήταν εδώ.  Γλυκό κορίτσι.  Σαν κόρη για μένα.  Πες της ο μπαμπάς Toto στέλνει χαιρετίσματα.
TMPTS71	Ζζζζζζζ.
TMPTS72	Ζζζζζζζ.
TMPTS73	Ζζζζζζζζ.
TMPTS74	Ακούνητος
TMPTS75	μην κινείσαι

TMPMA01	Hola, Toto. ΏCσmo estαs?
TMPMA02	Σε τι δουλεύεις εκεί;
TMPMA03	Κάμπια;
TMPMA04	Ποντίκι;
TMPMA05	Μια κάμπια που τρώει ένα ποντίκι;
TMPMA06	Παπούτσι είναι αυτό;
TMPMA07	Αυτό υποτίθεται πως είναι κουνέλι;
TMPMA08	Ωραίο φαίνεται, ότι και αν είναι.
TMPMA09	Το μάθημα ζωγραφικής βοήθησε πολύ.
TMPMA10	Συνέχισε την καλή δουλειά.
TMPMA11	Μπορώ να δοκιμάσω και εγώ λίγο;
TMPMA12	Σου ξέφυγε ένα σημείο.
TMPMA13	Δεν μπορώ να καταλάβω ακριβώς τι είναι, αλλά μοιάζει με τους γονείς μου που τσακώνονται.
TMPMA14	Νομίζω πως σε ακούω να τρίζεις τα δόντια σου. Δεν πρέπει να το κάνεις αυτό.
TMPMA15	Σκέφτομαι να πάω για ντόνατς. Θέλεις;
TMPMA16	Είναι ένα μικρό έπιπλο.
TMPMA17	Είναι άδειο.
TMPMA18	Υγρό άζωτο;
TMPMA19	Δυνατό πράγμα. Αυτό πραγματικά θα σκοτώνει τον πόνο.
TMPMA20	Αυτό είναι ένα παλιό ψυγείο.
TMPMA21	Δεν έχει τίποτα μέσα παρά λεκέδες.
TMPMA22	Μοιάζει με διατηρητή φρεσκάδας μαρουλιού.
TMPMA23	"μυρίζει" περισσότερο σαν διατηρητής φρεσκάδας "μούχλας", όμως.
TMPMA24	Πολλοί λεκέδες για κάποιον που δεν έχει σωματικά υγρά.
TMPMA25	Αμφιβάλλω αν θα το ακουμπήσω αυτό άμεσα.
TMPMA26	Ωωω, τώρα που το θυμήθηκα. Ξέχασα το ραντεβού μου με την Ινεζ!
TMPMA27	Εμπρός, κέντρο;
TMPMA28	Ναι, εγώ είμαι μωρό μου. Πώς το κατάλαβες;
TMPMA29	Έι, μη το λες αυτό γλυκιά μου. Ξέρεις πως ήθελα να περάσω--
TMPMA30	Χαίρομαι όλο και περισσότερο που θα φύγω από την πόλη.
TMPMA31	Νομίζω πως θα αφήσω για λίγο το τηλέφωνο. Τουλάχιστον μέχρι να ηρεμήσει η Ινεζ.
TMPMA32	Δε μου φαίνεται πως θα πας για δουλειά το πρωί.
TMPMA33	Για να δούμε τι έχεις πάνω σου ναύτη.
TMPMA34	Χμμμ
TMPMA35	Ναύτης Anselmo Naranja.  Ανθυποπλοίαρχος, τρίτης τάξης.
TMPMA36	Το ίδιο και εμείς.
TMPMA37	Μη με βάλεις ποτέ κάτω από αυτό το πράγμα.
TMPMA38	Σημαίνει κάτι για σένα αυτό;
TMPMA39	Ναι.
TMPMA40	Η φίλη μου η Lola το άφησε εδώ για μένα.
TMPMA41	Σίγουρα.
SYMA218	Βαρέθηκα να περιμένω για κάποιο καλό στοιχείο, λες και θα πεταχτεί εδώ πέρα δεμένο πάνω σε ένα τούβλο. 
SYMA219	Ήρθε η ώρα να ΠΑΡΩ ένα.

brbsv28a	Ελπίζω αυτό το πολύ επείγον μήνυμα να φτάσει εγκαίρως. Ο πράκτορας μας στο Zapato λέει ότι η Κυρία Colomar δεν έφτασε ποτέ στο λιμάνι. Λέγεται ότι πήδηξε στη θάλασσα στο Μαργαριτάρι.

p39ma04b	Να είσαι κάπου εδώ γύρω καλύτερα.
ODJMA02a	Μακάρι να το έβλεπες.
ODJMA02b	Ήταν ένα παλιό κόλπο.
POSGL03a	Αυτό ήταν το εύκολο μέρος.
POSGL03b	Το δύσκολο θα είναι να φύγουμε σπάζοντας αυτό το μεγάλο κοραλλένιο ύφαλο εκεί έξω!
sito026a	Για να δούμε... ε, νούμερο τριάντα... α, τριάντα-έξι, νάτο.
POSMA02a	Δεν μπορώ να το πιστέψω ότι το έκανες να επιπλέει.
POSMA02b	Απίστευτο! Χα χα χα!
POSMA04a	Να σπάσουμε τον μεγάλο κοραλλένιο ύφαλο, ε;
POSMA04b	Χμμμ
sima106a	Ωωω, αυτό μου θύμισε κάτι. 
sima106b	Ξέχασα το ραντεβού μου με την Inez!
sima074a	Δεν μπορεί να υπάρχουν πολλά εδώ μέσα.
sima108a	Ναι, εγώ ο Manny είμαι! 
sima108b	Περνούσα από την πόλη και--
sima074b	Καλύτερα να το φυλάξω.
sima110a	Ναι, εγώ είμαι μωρό μου.
sima110b	Πως το κατάλαβες;
sima111a	Εϊ, μη το λες αυτό καρδιά μου.
sima111b	Το ξέρεις ότι ήθελα να περάσω και --
sima128a	Σκέφτομαι να πάω για ντόνατς.
sima128b	Θέλεις;
sito028a	Ω, ω, ναι. Η Lola ήταν εδώ.  Γλυκό κορίτσι.
sito028b	Σαν κόρη για μένα.
sito028c	Πες της ο μπαμπάς Toto στέλνει χαιρετίσματα.
sito061a	Έι! Κλείσε την πόρτα!
sito061b	Επιβραδύνεται η συσκευή, πολύ επίπονο!
sito061c	Very painful, eh Naranja? Πολύ επίπονο, ε Naranja; Σαν βασανιστήριο, Χεχεχε...χεχε.
sito062a	Κλείσε την αναθεματισμένη πόρτα! Δεν έχει τίποτα να φας!
sito062b	Αν θέλεις να τσιμπήσεις κάτι, τράβα στη μάνα σου!! 
sito130a	Αργκ. Όχι τώρα, Manny.
sito130b	Έχω μια δουλειά με τον Naranja από εδώ.
sito063a	Έξω από το ψυγείο μου!
sito063b	[Μη με αναγκάσεις να έρθω εκεί και να σε πλακώσω στο ξύλο!]
sito132a	[Τι μπελάς.]
sito132b	[Μακάρι να το βούλωνε.]
sito066a	[Τι στο διάολο;]
sito066b	Κοίτα! Το έσπασες.
sito146a	Τι είναι αυτό; Μου γίνεται έλεγχος;
sito146b	Είσαι του υπουργείου υγείας ή κάτι τέτοιο;
sito146c	Φύγε από δω. Πλήρωσα αυτό το μήνα.
sito153a	Έχω να φάω Lengua (γλώσσα) από τότε που έκλεισες τον αυτόματο πωλητή!
sito153b	(αναστεναγμός) Εσύ και το φαντεζί φαγητό σου, (γκρινιάζοντας) με το μαϊντανό και τους κύκνους...
CPDGL12a	Ω, Η ΚΑΡΔΙΑ!  Η ΚΑΡΔΙΑ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΚΑΛΟ ΠΡΑΓΜΑ!
CPDGL12b	ΝΑ ΕΙΜΑΙ ΚΑΛΟΣ ΜΕ ΤΗΝ ΚΑΡΔΙΑ!
CPDGL12c	ΝΑ ΜΗΝ ΞΕΡΙΖΩΝΩ ΤΗΝ ΚΑΡΔΙΑ!
CPDGL12d	Η ΚΑΡΔΙΑ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΚΑΛΗ!
CPDGL12E	ΚΑΛΗ ΚΑΡΔΙΑ ΜΕ ΓΕΡΟΥΣ ΧΤΥΠΟΥΣ.
CPDGL12F	Έϊ, το αυτοκίνητο μου είναι αυτό;
P39MA10b	Δεν έχω καιρό να σε τιμωρήσω για την Lola, αλλά είμαι σίγουρος ότι κάποιος θα το κάνει.
p39vi09c	Μην στεναχωριέσαι γι'αυτό Manny.
p39vi09d	Απ'ότι ακούω, το να σώζεις γυναίκες δεν είναι το δυνατό σου σημείο.
PLGVL03a	Να προσέχεις που πατάς σε αυτά τα μέρη, ξένε.
PLGVL03b	Η Rubacava δεν είναι πια το ειδυλλιακό λιμανάκι που ήταν κάποτε.
PLGVL04a	Βρε βρε βρε. Σα να βλέπω ένα νέο καρυδότσουφλο στην πόλη.
PLGVL04b	Σχώρα με αλλά πάω να του ρίξω μια ματιά!
RM3CO15a	Μπες εκεί μέσα και μην κουνηθείς μέχρι τα παιδιά από τα κεντρικά να μας πούνε τι θέλουν να κάνουμε με σένα.
RM3CO15b	Κάποιος θα πληρώσει για ό,τι έγινε, Calavera, και αυτός δε θα είμαι εγώ!
sito148a	Πολύ μεγάλο -- Βγάλε όλο το χέρι.
sito148b	Κάν'το αυτό μόνο αν το σχέδιο δε βγήκε καλό.
RM_MA01	Buenos Dias.
IN_MA10	Everybody here is just as dead as you.
IN_MA11	That's why we call it the "Land of the Dead."
REUME02x	Manny!  What are you doing here?
REUMA03x	I wanted to see how your trip was going, Angel.  I AM your travel agent, you know.
LL_MA14	I coulda walked faster than this!  Rrr, hiνole, I'm gonna miss the poisoning!
BP_BO02	Cut the yap.  I want something cheap where I can get some rest, and that's it.
BP_CO20	If you haven't bagged a premium before the next sales report comes in, you're out!
RM_ME06	Guess they couldn't save me, eh?
RM_MA07	No, but there's still a chance you could save me.
LQ_SV11	I was once a reaper like yourself, Manuel.  But I uncovered a web of corruption in our beloved Department of Death.
LSASV09x	I have reason to believe that the Bureau of Acquisitions is cheating the very souls it was chartered to serve.  I think someone is robbing these poor, naοve souls of their rightful destinies, leaving them no option but to march on a treacherous trail of tears, unprotected and alone.  Like babies, Manuel. Like babies.
LSAMA10x	What's your evidence?
LSASV11x	That's where you come in, Manuel.  Or, should I call you "Agent Calavera?"
LSAMA12x	"Manny" suits me fine.  I'm not looking to join any military organization, Sal.  I just want my job back so I can work off my time and get out of this dump.
LSASV13x	Well, you won't even be able to get out of this city with out my help.  Which means, of course, you won't be able to find that woman, and you'll never get your job back.  When you're ready to join the cause, Manuel, come talk to me.  We might be of some use to each other.
CD_CO08	Hector!  No!
IDCMB02	It looks like I've got one of your boys down here in the morgue.
LLDLO09x	Tell me, Manny.  Would I have had a chance?
REUDO1x	Hahahahaha!
REUDO2x	I've got to get back to the city where the action is.
PL_VL03	You gotta watch your step around here, stranger. Rubacava ain't the quaint little port town she used to be.
ST_SV05	Manuel?  Are you
ST_SV06	in love with her?
ST_MA07	Love?  Love is for the living, Sal.  I'm only after her for one reason
ST_MA08	She's my ticket out of here.
BRUBO03	Ah, phooey!
BRUBO04x	I'm getting out of here.  This world's for suckers.
cfbo001a	Αυτό είναι άνω ποταμών!
cfbo002a	Ποντάρισα στο νούμερο δύο, γιατί δε βγήκε το νούμερο δύο;
cfbo059a	Λοιπόν, σε παρακαλώ πες στον "Κύριο πάνω" ότι ο αρχηγός της αστυνομίας ο Bogen ήταν πολύ συγχυσμένος όταν έφυγε...
cfbo007a	...και όταν επιστρέψει αργότερα απόψε το βράδυ, θα προτιμούσε να έχει καλύτερη τύχη!
cfcr003a	Ah Monsieur, je suis vraiment disoli, Ντεν ντιαλέγκω εγκώ τουζ νικιτέζ.

BRPCO20b	Έξω στο δρόμο! Χωρίς δουλειά! Χωρίς τρόπο να ξεχρεωθείς! Μόνο το φανταχτερό σου κοστούμι και το μεγάλο σου χαμόγελο και πολύ χρόνο να σκοτώσεις!
brbsv28b	Δεν ξέρω αν το πιστεύεις αυτό, αλλά ότι και να κάνεις, μην αγκυροβολήσεις στο Puerto Zapato! Είναι παγίδα. Δολοφόνοι θα προσπαθήσουν να επιβιβαστούν στο πλοίο μεταμφιεσμένοι ως τελωνιακοί πράκτορες.
brbsv28c	Φυλάξου! Και Viva la Revolucion!
SVSHE11b	Αυτό το αργό πράγμα θα σε ανθίσει, αλλά φοβάμαι ότι θα πάρει πολλή ώρα, λυπάμαι που το λέω.
LSASV09b	Πιστεύω πως κάποιος ληστεύει αυτές τις φτωχές ψυχές από το δίκαιο πεπρωμένο τους, αφήνοντας τους χωρίς επιλογή, από το να βαδίσουν σε ένα ύπουλο μονοπάτι δακρύων, απροστάτευτες και μόνες.
LSASV09c	Σαν μωρά, Manuel. Σαν μωρά.
LSASV13b	Όταν θα είσαι έτοιμος να συμμετάσχεις στους σκοπούς μας, Manuel, έλα να μου μιλήσεις. Ίσως μπορέσουμε να φανούμε χρήσιμοι ο ένας στον άλλο.
ODJHE01c	Είχαμε πολλές κενές θέσεις στο γραφείο τα τελευταία δύο χρόνια, και ειλικρινά είχαμε πρόβλημα να τις καλύψουμε. Θα μπορούσα να χρησιμοποιήσω έναν υπάλληλο σαν εσένα στην ομάδα.
RM3CO14b	Αυτή είναι η ανταμοιβή της, μετά από μια ζωή με κακουχίες και εθελοντικής εργασίας; Το πεπρωμένο της κλάπηκε από έναν φιλόδοξο απατεώνα πωλητή που έψαχνε για μια πλούσια προμήθεια που δεν άξιζε!
VMASV10b	Ο στρατός μας μεγάλωσε, και αυτή τη στιγμή οι κορυφαίοι πράκτορες μας βρίσκονται στο εργαστήριο όπλων του Hector, έτοιμοι να περικυκλώσουν τον εχθρό μέσα στην ίδια του τη φωλιά. Δεν θα τα κατάφερνα χωρίς εσένα, Manuel.
